review
"The infrastructure of the college is just awesome and should be appreciated to the architectures. I am going to describe this in few points. Firstly the color of dit university is don't having different color in different building a cemented brown premium color finish on all the building all around the glimpse of the musssorie mountain and having a beautiful Indian flag in the center of it in a garden. Dit university is comprises of having lifts,labs,automatic cleaning machines,smart light. I am studying BTECH in electronics and communication and i am very well satisfied with the academics of DIT as it syllabus related to CBCS Scheme the load of the syllabus is little high but the person with dedication and do it easily. Though the support of highly educated faculties and course notes access online. In the end of every semester they take a review from us about the course what difficulties we faced in it. The person having a maintained good CGPA around 7.5 or above can easily get a good placements in the listed companies like- INFOSYS, INFOTECH, HCL ,HP, WIPRO , REALINCE, JIO, AIRTEL ,VODAPHONE AND MANY MORE Multinational Companies. Just focus and studies and academics and you'll easily get a good placement above 6.5lac and higher upto 2.1cr I think a little bit higher charges of fees is not value for money as charging 2lac per annum is quite high it should be around 1.4lac so then it might be better and good for the students. Every course has differnet structures of fees and very costly above 1 lac each semester. Overall experience is good and enjoying in the campus as the timings and breaks of the lecture is good we get a lot of time of enjoyment and studies as well and also get extra curricular activities like club and social programs that is also necessary for students. We love DIT for this. 10/9 1 marks for the fees that is quite high that should be maintained or some entrance exam based scholarship for the students might be a good option to overcome this."
"I am satisfied about my college infrastructure and it is so clean and well maintained , if i am telling about my block it just very beautiful and the way they had that hygienic , they had the very well living spaces means hostels. Academics is good not so bed if i am telling about computer science in it department we have too much opportunity and platforms are good also teacher are good but the sometime they don;t come on the time , another they well qualified. Placements are good in computer science department but not in all departments so i am lucky that i have computer science and engineering department and i am happy to take the placement schedule over there. It is not too much costly per year over there , They help to students and give the loan if the students are not able to pay that much so that means they have own bank formalities and i feel that my course is money's worthy. over there if i am telling about campus life it is fantabulous and the overall campus has own beauty and the campus is very good background space over there so that means the whole campus has beautiful view. The overall campus has own beauty in the manner of academy and about the placement and the infrastructure and the main thing is library is so good they give us books to read for 15 days on once issue,"
The infrastructure is quite good and well maintained and has nearly all of the facilities required in a university and also have gyms both for girls and boys separate. The tuck shops are also good and you'll find things necessary for yourself easily. The professor are quite helpful and help a lot with your academics and also help with your projects and also recommend what are the things that you need to do for completing the course and also what you should do to get a good placement There are companies coming to the campus and also the campus provides a good number of opportunities for getting well placed it all depends on you how you use the opportunities provided by them otherwise if you even study in IIT you'll end up landing nowhere. The campus life is very good.

The University follows ugc guidelines . Syllabus is updated time to time . Faculty has deep knowledge and are friendly in nature ( not all ) . Proper guidance is given to each student . And whatever we going to learn over here makes us future ready . But still there are some area of improvement . Placement is one of the key factor and i must say that it is quite good as compared to other colleges of the same level . About 90% of people get placed every year and highest package is about 35lakhs and avg package is 5 to 10 lakh per annum . To make the placement process easy and pleasant our college has a placement cell which help the students to prepare for the interview process. And i must say at the time of placement faculty is very much supportive and encouraging. It's totally depends on your field as i am from engineering field my fees is around 2 to 2.15 lakhs per annum and i do feel it is quite much. People who are from uttrakhand gets an additional discount of 26% in tuition fees. The University almost provide with everything we need from facilities to faculties and i do feel that my parents money is getting used properly. Campus life in my college is best .

"I joined DIT University in the year 2018.The infrastructure of the college is well maintained. Washrooms facilities in some buildings could be better. Labs are well organized and maintained. Libraries are quite good. E - books facilities are also available in the libraries, computer's section is also well equipped. Hostel food is bearable. The best part is college WiFi. Overall the environment is peaceful and positive. The location is extremely good surrounded by the beautiful view of hills. I am pursuing BA (Hons.) English. I always wanted to study about English language and literature in depth. The university follows the UGC guidelines so everything is carefully taken care of. Syllabus is updated timely. Faculties are extremely helpful, kind and friendly. Proper guidance and exercises that we practice do make us job ready. It helps in shaping the base. Though there are some area of improvements and they need to work on them. University offers a wide range of placements opportunities. They also organize sessions to help us being ready for the interviews and placement activities. The highest salary package was offered to an economic honours student that was approx 12 lakhsperannum. Mostly students who worked hard on themselves get placed.I have no idea about the how the placement process takes place because I haven't gotten chance to sit for it as I am in second year. The university is supportive. My course cost around 80 thousands per year. I do feel that my parents money is getting used properly. The university provides us with almost everything that we want. Facilities are quite good and faculties are helpful. The environment is quite peaceful and positive. The best part is location. Beautiful place. Faculties are hard working. They do work hard on each and every student. They are really supportive. Teaching quality is impressive as well and ample of opportunities to explore oneself. University campus is beautiful.

Faculties and other staff members are kind and helpful. Discipline is maintained. well i would say the university is quite good but it can get better.

"Nyc environment and great view. The place is itself worth evrytime to be just because of its location. Mussorie is 22 kms away and the new cafeteria adds the beauty in the overall. The rating here for view and beauty is 10/10 There are some of good teachers for which iam gonna say the academics are well. Just for the sake i would say mostly it depends upn you whether u want to study or not. Distractions are much, if u smoke weed and other stuffs then u r gonna waste ample of time here,else if u are focused u can do well in xams. There is time to do more courses which u can do or other research works with teachers, and hence only the mid terms happening in each sem, than the end term makes the fever of xams high...... Its getting better day by day. Core companies are less, if you are from cs or it than placement scenario is quite well, else for PE ece or ee mech, u are gonna see that no or least company visit, mostly the cs students get good package just because of the reason because the it companies are well and core are least. Secure meters visit for ece and ee, cs again will get edge in it so you can go for off campus as well.. But it feels wasting money here just because core companies visit so less here. Fee structure is damn high.. The fees have gone to a high level again, i would say that a min of 16 lakhs will go on study here. For btech students and hence it is quite high. If the rank is seen then the fee must be feasible but here we will see hyke in fees both hostel and academics evry year.u will definitely think to get a degree from any of normal college where too much money will not be wasted, it comes evry year in mind that the manner in which fees goes so much makes us think again...... College life will be memorable. Hostel food is sumtimes well bt mostly ur money will be wasted for food outside and it sill definitely make ur monthly pay even more. Try to cope up with situations. And please try to clear all the subjects, one back means 3000rs and without classes rs 500 therefore try to not get backs or debar and be well in studies, try to do sum alternative stuffs so that u will be seen a different human here as it eill distinguish you from others out here. No of students are Acc to me its worth the money,because u will enjoy evry moment, the buildings are quite well maintained leaving our Chanakya which is oldest but as we came in our 3rd year, the building also got maintained and therefore all the buildings now are well. I would say you will enjoy hostel life leaving its food. U will waste much money each month and at end it will come to mind how to manage the money. If u r in love here please try to cope up because 2x money will be laid during those moments.thnks."
A outstanding infrastructure of college with having some beautiful view from the college. Mountain of mussoorie seems beautiful and the buildingz ofbthe college very nice and good and well maintained here. Good and well experienced teachers a good curriculum is designed here for the students but their is not a good labs for the students but we call it a average labs facility are given here . And a well maintained and good technicians are also. Altough a good record of placement here . But there package is not exceeds nore than 25 lac. Also the average package is aroung 6 to 7 lac. But although a worth college for the students who is doing his graduation. Good I love my college and happy for being part of this college
"Infrastructure is good. Here u will get the sufficient equipments for everything like sports and other activities. Cricketers are provided with their kits.... common for a team. Same case for other sports team also. You will also be provided your own name jersey in diff. Sports. Falculty is good anyway. There are teachers who will always help you out in your studies and also in your personal matters if you did like to share with them but there are few who doesn't cares about you and your future a lot . Placements are good for CSE department students and average is around 3.5 lacs per annum is considered good as a beginner. nearly which. But placements for other branch students are not so good and they have to trouble a lot for that If you just wanna pay the BTech fees over here, it's nearly 2.26 lacs for 1st year , 2.5 lacs for 2nd year, 2.65 for 3rd year and 2.75 for final year if you are from CSE department in this college which is the most in this college. Fees is little bit more as compared to other colleges in UK. Campus life over here is so good. If you are a hostler then you must be enjoying the college life at its fullest as the environment is very playful and joyful. You will never miss the sunsets over here if you are obsessed with it. Overall the college is good if you study overhere and you will surely get paid for that. If you top in your class, then you will be provided scholarship which is good , which motivates every student to study. Girls toppers are also provided scholarship from each class"
"In the lap of mountains filled with greenery DIT University is one of most prestigious colleges in Uttrakhand.It comprises of all facilities that a proper college campus should have whether its cafeteria, amphitheater, variety of sports and etc. Talking about classrooms it also serves with proper teaching equipments i.e.,smart boards and other basic things. Last but not least Hostels are home away from home which serves good food and proper accommodation according to our needs. I am a student of B.Tech 3rd year from Computer Science.Seeing the future scope and exposure to outside world I opted for Computer Science Engineering. The curriculum is upto date including the present happenings in outside world regarding latest developments and achievements in CS department helping each and every student job ready. Placements play a major role in choosing colleges. But DIT University in this context has been upto the mark since the day I joined the college. Listening from seniors talk last year almost 95percent students got placed with flying colors and a handsome salary. Average salary was around 5LPA which is not a bad start to a career. Various types of courses are offered here. Although mine is Core CS but we also have collaboration with IT giants like IBM and Oracle which provides depth in choosing. For core cost per year is around 3 lacs including hostel but for collaborative its around 4 lacs. A wonderful place to spend the important 4 years of your life with full of adventures, enthusiasm,fun and lot more to be explored within the time period. Come and experience it with your own experience."
"The infrastructure of the dit university have all the necessary infrastructure, facilities for their staff as well as for students. The classrooms and the laboratories are well maintained. But their is lack of facilities for the sports. There is only single playing area which is in the boys hostel. But this university deserves 5 rating for cleanliness and hygiene as the environment near the dit university is extremely well so it is best as per the infrastructure and cleanliness. I am the student of B.tech in Computer science and engineering. I am a 2nd year student and have interest in programming. As far I have seen the professors at dit university are good and provide you the quality content for university exams as well as for other competitive exams. Some of the facilities are the best and always encourage students as per their interest and passion. As it is the private university so here comes it's benifit that the curriculum is updated with latest technologies The placement in dit university is enhancing day by day. The average package is 4.5 lakhs per annum and the highest package is 25 lakhs pee annum. In cs department the placement is around 90% (maximum) and the highest as compared to other departments. Dit university is very supportive regarding the placement as they help each and every student to improve their skills and help them to find the better options for them. Computer science in dit university costs around 2-3 lakhs per annum. It's high as compared to some colleges but I think it's worth. As they provide all the facilities and take actions actively. And at the end maximum students get placed and from my point of you that this is why we are going to the college. The campus life is very nice at the dit university. Students can engage in cultural activities sports and other technical events. There are so many clubs and you can join them as per your interest. The students and the facilities in the dit university are very helpful and they always help you . The dit university is located in makka wala and near to musafir which make the environment and the view moat beautiful and you will feel so pleasant.

Indoor games, well maintained canteen and Atmosphere of the college is very good."
"The college infrastructure is excellent. College provides all the facility to the students.The classes are well maintained and have all the necessary things projector, Good and hygiene sound observer etc.Everything is well maintained and taken proper Maintenance is taken.The hostel has common room where you can watch match as TV is there.Hostel is clean and hygiene.

My course cost 3 lakh per year.I feel my getting my money worth on average as the academics is good but the placement is weak.so you should try to prepare for gate examination and other higher examination and also try to get placement offline.But academically the I am getting my money worth. The campus life is excellent the college is between the hills of Missouri so the atmosphere is excellent and you feel very relax here.The student can engage in many extra curricular activities. It has collaboration with max hospital so in case you become I'll there is proper treatment for you. Overall college is good for civil but placement is weak."
"Yes, it has all necessary facilities available. Environment is so pleasant and clean. Wifi has high speed internet access. Hostel and mess facilities are good enough. Surrounding is so satisfactory here. Department of Computer Science is awesome here. Syllabus is well updated. teachers are teaching well, they are able to clear the doubts that arise when they lectures. I felt the classes interesting, but there are some students who doesnt understands the class because they are indulged in the mobile phones. The curriculum is not updated and is of the past years. Quality of placement is very good here. placement is pretty good for my branch which is the computer science engineering. We have a good placement among all other branches of the college. There is also some good companies visiting our college for campus placement. My course cost 2 lakhs per year. It is worth it for all the facilities and faculties available. Awesome Campus life, surrounded with green mountains. DIT University is a great place to study Engineering."
"The college has overall great views at all around because it is located in foothills of Mussorie. So, whenever there is a cloudy day you can't stop yourself to capture the landscape. Now talking about the academics as the labs are well equipped but there is lack of proper academic calender and also there is lack faculty in the department for the different subjects. Also all the academic buildings are equipped with good wifi network. All the campus building are clean surroundings. I am pursuing my BTECH in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Automobile Engineering is good but here the faculty&amp;labs not available for various optional subjects which we wanted to learn in the last semesters. The quality of placement for mechanical branch is almost zero percent. Out of 100students 1 or 3 gets placed.The ratio of placement for mechanical branch is very less.All you need to do is to improve your academic and look for out campus. The course cost approx 2.5 lakh per year.If you look at academic It's totally value for money but if your need is placement than you will not get the worth of your money.Very few companies visit for hiring Mechanical and Automobile Engineering students. Yeah the money which I spent is worth for doing this course. The overall campus life is good. As, here we celebrate different festivals with great enthusiasm under college faculty guidelines. Different events also organised by students such as Youthopia which is annual cultural and technical fest and lots of small events which are organised by students of different courses. The overall experience at this college was good for me till now. Initially when I came to this college at that time the management was good but now I'm in 3 year and at this time management was not so good. Hope they will recover there system back ."
"Good, can be improved, some of the classes lack the projector facility otherwise the classes are good, and talking about Infrastructure it is absolutely fine and one can surely work on them, electronics are also in good condition. Satisfying, I am an Engineering student from Cse 3rd year, and I have a interest in tech and the faculty here is good, they always try to help us in one or other ways. The curriculum is fine but sometimes there are too, unnecessary things to do. Need more companies, the placement ratio is good over the years, but also in recent years there has been a crackdown in the ratio. The highest package last year was around 16 to 20 LPA. The average is around 4.5 LPA. Expensive though, the fee is quite high, my course cost me around or above 2 Lakh, it depends on the working of students whether they get there worth or not, for me I totally think I'm not getting it, because I have come with many more dreams which college fails to provide support for. Good, it is fine, the best features are, we have good space to hang around, and a good library to sit and have some self study. The support staff depends person by person some teachers always try to help, while some don't. Fine"
"Yes,the college have all the facilities and infrastructure and equipment every branch lab has all the facilities to perform lab work.The classrooms are have projector and sound observer which helps students to hear facilities nicely .They have been taken very good care with proper maintenance.The college,hostel and college campus is totally clean and food are also hyegnic I am btech cse student i got suggestions from my seniors that the college have very nice academic and the placement senario for cse is very nice.The curriculum is updated and the student are made aware of all the new technology and research .The CDC helps your to get ready for the placment and make you job ready. The quality of placment for computer science is excellent.Where as it is less in other branches and approx very less in petro,ee,civil.The highest sallary offered is 22 lakh for cse student and for petroleum student was also same but to very less.The sallary offered average is 4 lakh.The college is very supportive. It costed approx 3 lakh per year.There are many collaboration courses in dit you can choose them.They are from IBM,ORCAL etc their fees is higer but is beneficial for future.I feel if you get placed you will get your money worth try to do best in 4 year of course and get your money worth.Even i feel my money worth. The campus life is very nice it is near by mussorie and has excellent atmosphere.There are many club in college where you can get involved.The student gets very nice teacher as well as supportive staff.The Problem is that you will not get a bus auto anything to come college after 7 pm for that you need private vechile.But overall everything is good and can handle all emergency. Give your best in the 4 year of degree and you will achieve everything you want."
"The college have all the necessary infrastructure, facilities and equipment.Each and every branch have well equipped equipment which are necessary for practical that need to be performed while course.The college have smart boards the library are very big and have all the used book.The sports facilities is little weak.Where as the hostel and college leaving space are clean and hygienic. I am a student of btech CSE student and i get to know from my senior about the college.The academic of college is very good in comparison to other college of Dehradun.The curriculum is upto date.Students are made aware of the new opportunities by the faculty.If u give your 100 percent it will make you job ready. The quality of placement is good in computer science .The placement scenario of ece is good but the placement of other branches is very bad.The computer science students almost get all placed try to don't have any back logs till last sem.The average sallary is approx 4 lakh for CSE student but other branches it can be sure. The course cost per year is approx 3 lakh.If you want best academic you can choose this college and placement for CSE is also good.Hence if your motive is to get placement than you must choose CSE and you will get the value of money .I am in CSE and i fill i am getting value for my money. The college campus has very good life.The best is atmosphere and the worst is the college don't have a play ground . Student can engage them in various club.The student,staff as well as faculty are very supportive and helpful. Choose the college fort cse .It is best for cse course other than any branches."
"The infrastructure of the college is just awesome and should be appreciated to the architectures. I am going to describe this in few points. Firstly the color of dit university is don't having different color in different building a cemented brown premium color finish on all the building all around the glimpse of the musssorie mountain and having a beautiful Indian flag in the center of it in a garden. Dit university is comprises of having lifts,labs,automatic cleaning machines,smart light. I am studying BTECH in electronics and communication and i am very well satisfied with the academics of DIT as it syllabus related to CBCS Scheme the load of the syllabus is little high but the person with dedication and do it easily. Though the support of highly educated faculties and course notes access online. In the end of every semester they take a review from us about the course what difficulties we faced in it. The person having a maintained good CGPA around 7.5 or above can easily get a good placements in the listed companies like- INFOSYS, INFOTECH, HCL ,HP, WIPRO , REALINCE, JIO, AIRTEL ,VODAPHONE AND MANY MORE Multinational Companies. Just focus and studies and academics and you'll easily get a good placement above 6.5lac and higher upto 2.1cr I think a little bit higher charges of fees is not value for money as charging 2lac per annum is quite high it should be around 1.4lac so then it might be better and good for the students. Every course has differnet structures of fees and very costly above 1 lac each semester. Overall experience is good and enjoying in the campus as the timings and breaks of the lecture is good we get a lot of time of enjoyment and studies as well and also get extra curricular activities like club and social programs that is also necessary for students. We love DIT for this. 10/9 1 marks for the fees that is quite high that should be maintained or some entrance exam based scholarship for the students might be a good option to overcome this."
"I am satisfied about my college infrastructure and it is so clean and well maintained , if i am telling about my block it just very beautiful and the way they had that hygienic , they had the very well living spaces means hostels. Academics is good not so bed if i am telling about computer science in it department we have too much opportunity and platforms are good also teacher are good but the sometime they don;t come on the time , another they well qualified. Placements are good in computer science department but not in all departments so i am lucky that i have computer science and engineering department and i am happy to take the placement schedule over there. It is not too much costly per year over there , They help to students and give the loan if the students are not able to pay that much so that means they have own bank formalities and i feel that my course is money's worthy. over there if i am telling about campus life it is fantabulous and the overall campus has own beauty and the campus is very good background space over there so that means the whole campus has beautiful view. The overall campus has own beauty in the manner of academy and about the placement and the infrastructure and the main thing is library is so good they give us books to read for 15 days on once issue,"
The infrastructure is quite good and well maintained and has nearly all of the facilities required in a university and also have gyms both for girls and boys separate.

"Nyc environment and great view. The place is itself worth evrytime to be just because of its location. Mussorie is 22 kms away and the new cafeteria adds the beauty in the overall. The rating here for view and beauty is 10/10 There are some of good teachers for which iam gonna say the academics are well. Just for the sake i would say mostly it depends upn you whether u want to study or not. Distractions are much, if u smoke weed and other stuffs then u r gonna waste ample of time here,else if u are focused u can do well in xams. There is time to do more courses which u can do or other research works with teachers, and hence only the mid terms happening in each sem, than the end term makes the fever of xams high...... Its getting better day by day. Core companies are less, if you are from cs or it than placement scenario is quite well, else for PE ece or ee mech, u are gonna see that no or least company visit, mostly the cs students get good package just because of the reason because the it companies are well and core are least. Secure meters visit for ece and ee, cs again will get edge in it so you can go for off campus as well.. But it feels wasting money here just because core companies visit so less here. Fee structure is damn high.. The fees have gone to a high level again, i would say that a min of 16 lakhs will go on study here. For btech students and hence it is quite high. If the rank is seen then the fee must be feasible but here we will see hyke in fees both hostel and academics evry year.u will definitely think to get a degree from any of normal college where too much money will not be wasted, it comes evry year in mind that the manner in which fees goes so much makes us think again...... College life will be memorable. Hostel food is sumtimes well bt mostly ur money will be wasted for food outside and it sill definitely make ur monthly pay even more. Try to cope up with situations. And please try to clear all the subjects, one back means 3000rs and without classes rs 500 therefore try to not get backs or debar and be well in studies, try to do sum alternative stuffs so that u will be seen a different human here as it eill distinguish you from others out here. No of students are Acc to me its worth the money,because u will enjoy evry moment, the buildings are quite well maintained leaving our Chanakya which is oldest but as we came in our 3rd year, the building also got maintained and therefore all the buildings now are well. I would say you will enjoy hostel life leaving its food. U will waste much money each month and at end it will come to mind how to manage the money. If u r in love here please try to cope up because 2x money will be laid during those moments.thnks."
A outstanding infrastructure of college with having some beautiful view from the college. Mountain of mussoorie seems beautiful and the buildingz ofbthe college very nice and good and well maintained here. Good and well experienced teachers a good curriculum is designed here for the students but their is not a good labs for the students but we call it a average labs facility are given here . And a well maintained and good technicians are also. Altough a good record of placement here . But there package is not exceeds nore than 25 lac. Also the average package is aroung 6 to 7 lac. But although a worth college for the students who is doing his graduation. Good I love my college and happy for being part of this college
"Infrastructure is good. Here u will get the sufficient equipments for everything like sports and other activities. Cricketers are provided with their kits.... common for a team. Same case for other sports team also. You will also be provided your own name jersey in diff. Sports. Falculty is good anyway. There are teachers who will always help you out in your studies and also in your personal matters if you did like to share with them but there are few who doesn't cares about you and your future a lot . Placements are good for CSE department students and average is around 3.5 lacs per annum is considered good as a beginner. nearly which. But placements for other branch students are not so good and they have to trouble a lot for that If you just wanna pay the BTech fees over here, it's nearly 2.26 lacs for 1st year , 2.5 lacs for 2nd year, 2.65 for 3rd year and 2.75 for final year if you are from CSE department in this college which is the most in this college. Fees is little bit more as compared to other colleges in UK. Campus life over here is so good. If you are a hostler then you must be enjoying the college life at its fullest as the environment is very playful and joyful. You will never miss the sunsets over here if you are obsessed with it. Overall the college is good if you study overhere and you will surely get paid for that. If you top in your class, then you will be provided scholarship which is good , which motivates every student to study. Girls toppers are also provided scholarship from each class"
"In the lap of mountains filled with greenery DIT University is one of most prestigious colleges in Uttrakhand.It comprises of all facilities that a proper college campus should have whether its cafeteria, amphitheater, variety of sports and etc. Talking about classrooms it also serves with proper teaching equipments i.e.,smart boards and other basic things. Last but not least Hostels are home away from home which serves good food and proper accommodation according to our needs. I am a student of B.Tech 3rd year from Computer Science.Seeing the future scope and exposure to outside world I opted for Computer Science Engineering. The curriculum is upto date including the present happenings in outside world regarding latest developments and achievements in CS department helping each and every student job ready. Placements play a major role in choosing colleges. But DIT University in this context has been upto the mark since the day I joined the college. Listening from seniors talk last year almost 95percent students got placed with flying colors and a handsome salary. Average salary was around 5LPA which is not a bad start to a career. Various types of courses are offered here. Although mine is Core CS but we also have collaboration with IT giants like IBM and Oracle which provides depth in choosing. For core cost per year is around 3 lacs including hostel but for collaborative its around 4 lacs. A wonderful place to spend the important 4 years of your life with full of adventures, enthusiasm,fun and lot more to be explored within the time period. Come and experience it with your own experience."
"The infrastructure of the dit university have all the necessary infrastructure, facilities for their staff as well as for students. The classrooms and the laboratories are well maintained. But their is lack of facilities for the sports. There is only single playing area which is in the boys hostel.

I am the student of B.tech in Computer science and engineering. I am a 2nd year student and have interest in programming. As far I have seen the professors at dit university are good and provide you the quality content for university exams as well as for other competitive exams. Some of the facilities are the best and always encourage students as per their interest and passion. As it is the private university so here comes it's benifit that the curriculum is updated with latest technologies The placement in dit university is enhancing day by day. The average package is 4.5 lakhs per annum and the highest package is 25 lakhs pee annum. In cs department the placement is around 90% (maximum) and the highest as compared to other departments. Dit university is very supportive regarding the placement as they help each and every student to improve their skills and help them to find the better options for them. Computer science in dit university costs around 2-3 lakhs per annum. It's high as compared to some colleges but I think it's worth. As they provide all the facilities and take actions actively. And at the end maximum students get placed and from my point of you that this is why we are going to the college. The campus life is very nice at the dit university. Students can engage in cultural activities sports and other technical events. There are so many clubs and you can join them as per your interest. The students and the facilities in the dit university are very helpful and they always help you . The dit university is located in makka wala and near to musafir which make the environment and the view moat beautiful and you will feel so pleasant.

College provides all the facility to the students.The classes are well maintained and have all the necessary things projector, Good and hygiene sound observer etc.Everything is well maintained and taken proper Maintenance is taken.The hostel has common room where you can watch match as TV is there.Hostel is clean and hygiene. Proper cleaning is done each and every day. The academics is excellent.The professor are very nice and friendly. I am biotech civil student we have an excellent lab and have all the equipment. The faculty are very supportive and help in everything. We have seminars and workshop related to over field which is very helpful and curriculum is totally updated. Placement is very poor when compared to other branches in dit.The placement scenario of civil is very low.The college is overall supportive and is trying to convince company to recruit the civil students.Whereas some of student has also got places that is 2 out 100. My course cost 3 lakh per year.I feel my getting my money worth on average as the academics is good but the placement is weak.so you should try to prepare for gate examination and other higher examination and also try to get placement offline.But academically the I am getting my money worth. The campus life is excellent the college is between the hills of Missouri so the atmosphere is excellent and you feel very relax here.The student can engage in many extra curricular activities. It has collaboration with max hospital so in case you become I'll there is proper treatment for you. Overall college is good for civil but placement is weak."
"Yes, it has all necessary facilities available. Environment is so pleasant and clean. Wifi has high speed internet access. Hostel and mess facilities are good enough. Surrounding is so satisfactory here. Department of Computer Science is awesome here. Syllabus is well updated. teachers are teaching well, they are able to clear the doubts that arise when they lectures. I felt the classes interesting, but there are some students who doesnt understands the class because they are indulged in the mobile phones. The curriculum is not updated and is of the past years. Quality of placement is very good here. placement is pretty good for my branch which is the computer science engineering. We have a good placement among all other branches of the college. There is also some good companies visiting our college for campus placement. My course cost 2 lakhs per year. It is worth it for all the facilities and faculties available. Awesome Campus life, surrounded with green mountains. DIT University is a great place to study Engineering."
"The college has overall great views at all around because it is located in foothills of Mussorie. So, whenever there is a cloudy day you can't stop yourself to capture the landscape. Now talking about the academics as the labs are well equipped but there is lack of proper academic calender and also there is lack faculty in the department for the different subjects. Also all the academic buildings are equipped with good wifi network. All the campus building are clean surroundings. I am pursuing my BTECH in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Automobile Engineering is good but here the faculty&amp;labs not available for various optional subjects which we wanted to learn in the last semesters. The quality of placement for mechanical branch is almost zero percent. Out of 100students 1 or 3 gets placed.The ratio of placement for mechanical branch is very less.All you need to do is to improve your academic and look for out campus. The course cost approx 2.5 lakh per year.If you look at academic It's totally value for money but if your need is placement than you will not get the worth of your money.Very few companies visit for hiring Mechanical and Automobile Engineering students. Yeah the money which I spent is worth for doing this course. The overall campus life is good. As, here we celebrate different festivals with great enthusiasm under college faculty guidelines. Different events also organised by students such as Youthopia which is annual cultural and technical fest and lots of small events which are organised by students of different courses. The overall experience at this college was good for me till now. Initially when I came to this college at that time the management was good but now I'm in 3 year and at this time management was not so good. Hope they will recover there system back ."
"Good, can be improved, some of the classes lack the projector facility otherwise the classes are good, and talking about Infrastructure it is absolutely fine and one can surely work on them, electronics are also in good condition. Satisfying, I am an Engineering student from Cse 3rd year, and I have a interest in tech and the faculty here is good, they always try to help us in one or other ways. The curriculum is fine but sometimes there are too, unnecessary things to do. Need more companies, the placement ratio is good over the years, but also in recent years there has been a crackdown in the ratio. The highest package last year was around 16 to 20 LPA. The average is around 4.5 LPA. Expensive though, the fee is quite high, my course cost me around or above 2 Lakh, it depends on the working of students whether they get there worth or not, for me I totally think I'm not getting it, because I have come with many more dreams which college fails to provide support for. Good, it is fine, the best features are, we have good space to hang around, and a good library to sit and have some self study. The support staff depends person by person some teachers always try to help, while some don't. Fine"
"Yes,the college have all the facilities and infrastructure and equipment every branch lab has all the facilities to perform lab work.The classrooms are have projector and sound observer which helps students to hear facilities nicely .They have been taken very good care with proper maintenance.The college,hostel and college campus is totally clean and food are also hyegnic I am btech cse student i got suggestions from my seniors that the college have very nice academic and the placement senario for cse is very nice.The curriculum is updated and the student are made aware of all the new technology and research .The CDC helps your to get ready for the placment and make you job ready. The quality of placment for computer science is excellent.Where as it is less in other branches and approx very less in petro,ee,civil.The highest sallary offered is 22 lakh for cse student and for petroleum student was also same but to very less.The sallary offered average is 4 lakh.The college is very supportive. It costed approx 3 lakh per year.There are many collaboration courses in dit you can choose them.They are from IBM,ORCAL etc their fees is higer but is beneficial for future.I feel if you get placed you will get your money worth try to do best in 4 year of course and get your money worth.Even i feel my money worth. The campus life is very nice it is near by mussorie and has excellent atmosphere.There are many club in college where you can get involved.The student gets very nice teacher as well as supportive staff.The Problem is that you will not get a bus auto anything to come college after 7 pm for that you need private vechile.But overall everything is good and can handle all emergency. Give your best in the 4 year of degree and you will achieve everything you want."
"The college have all the necessary infrastructure, facilities and equipment.Each and every branch have well equipped equipment which are necessary for practical that need to be performed while course.The college have smart boards the library are very big and have all the used book.The sports facilities is little weak.Where as the hostel and college leaving space are clean and hygienic. I am a student of btech CSE student and i get to know from my senior about the college.The academic of college is very good in comparison to other college of Dehradun.The curriculum is upto date.Students are made aware of the new opportunities by the faculty.If u give your 100 percent it will make you job ready. The quality of placement is good in computer science .The placement scenario of ece is good but the placement of other branches is very bad.The computer science students almost get all placed try to don't have any back logs till last sem.The average sallary is approx 4 lakh for CSE student but other branches it can be sure. The course cost per year is approx 3 lakh.If you want best academic you can choose this college and placement for CSE is also good.Hence if your motive is to get placement than you must choose CSE and you will get the value of money .I am in CSE and i fill i am getting value for my money. The college campus has very good life.The best is atmosphere and the worst is the college don't have a play ground . Student can engage them in various club.The student,staff as well as faculty are very supportive and helpful. Choose the college fort cse .It is best for cse course other than any branches."
"The infrastructure of the college is just awesome and should be appreciated to the architectures. I am going to describe this in few points. Firstly the color of dit university is don't having different color in different building a cemented brown premium color finish on all the building all around the glimpse of the musssorie mountain and having a beautiful Indian flag in the center of it in a garden. Dit university is comprises of having lifts,labs,automatic cleaning machines,smart light. I am studying BTECH in electronics and communication and i am very well satisfied with the academics of DIT as it syllabus related to CBCS Scheme the load of the syllabus is little high but the person with dedication and do it easily. Though the support of highly educated faculties and course notes access online. In the end of every semester they take a review from us about the course what difficulties we faced in it. The person having a maintained good CGPA around 7.5 or above can easily get a good placements in the listed companies like- INFOSYS, INFOTECH, HCL ,HP, WIPRO , REALINCE, JIO, AIRTEL ,VODAPHONE AND MANY MORE Multinational Companies. Just focus and studies and academics and you'll easily get a good placement above 6.5lac and higher upto 2.1cr I think a little bit higher charges of fees is not value for money as charging 2lac per annum is quite high it should be around 1.4lac so then it might be better and good for the students. Every course has differnet structures of fees and very costly above 1 lac each semester. Overall experience is good and enjoying in the campus as the timings and breaks of the lecture is good we get a lot of time of enjoyment and studies as well and also get extra curricular activities like club and social programs that is also necessary for students. We love DIT for this. 10/9 1 marks for the fees that is quite high that should be maintained or some entrance exam based scholarship for the students might be a good option to overcome this."
"I am satisfied about my college infrastructure and it is so clean and well maintained , if i am telling about my block it just very beautiful and the way they had that hygienic , they had the very well living spaces means hostels. Academics is good not so bed if i am telling about computer science in it department we have too much opportunity and platforms are good also teacher are good but the sometime they don;t come on the time , another they well qualified. Placements are good in computer science department but not in all departments so i am lucky that i have computer science and engineering department and i am happy to take the placement schedule over there. It is not too much costly per year over there , They help to students and give the loan if the students are not able to pay that much so that means they have own bank formalities and i feel that my course is money's worthy. over there if i am telling about campus life it is fantabulous and the overall campus has own beauty and the campus is very good background space over there so that means the whole campus has beautiful view. The overall campus has own beauty in the manner of academy and about the placement and the infrastructure and the main thing is library is so good they give us books to read for 15 days on once issue,"
The infrastructure is quite good and well maintained and has nearly all of the facilities required in a university and also have gyms both for girls and boys separate. The tuck shops are also good and you'll find things necessary for yourself easily. The professor are quite helpful and help a lot with your academics and also help with your projects and also recommend what are the things that you need to do for completing the course and also what you should do to get a good placement There are companies coming to the campus and also the campus provides a good number of opportunities for getting well placed it all depends on you how you use the opportunities provided by them otherwise if you even study in IIT you'll end up landing nowhere. The campus life is very good.

Though there are some area of improvements and they need to work on them. University offers a wide range of placements opportunities. They also organize sessions to help us being ready for the interviews and placement activities. The highest salary package was offered to an economic honours student that was approx 12 lakhsperannum.

The university is supportive. My course cost around 80 thousands per year. I do feel that my parents money is getting used properly. The university provides us with almost everything that we want. Facilities are quite good and faculties are helpful. The environment is quite peaceful and positive. The best part is location. Beautiful place. Faculties are hard working.

"Nyc environment and great view. The place is itself worth evrytime to be just because of its location. Mussorie is 22 kms away and the new cafeteria adds the beauty in the overall. The rating here for view and beauty is 10/10 There are some of good teachers for which iam gonna say the academics are well. Just for the sake i would say mostly it depends upn you whether u want to study or not. Distractions are much, if u smoke weed and other stuffs then u r gonna waste ample of time here,else if u are focused u can do well in xams. There is time to do more courses which u can do or other research works with teachers, and hence only the mid terms happening in each sem, than the end term makes the fever of xams high...... Its getting better day by day. Core companies are less, if you are from cs or it than placement scenario is quite well, else for PE ece or ee mech, u are gonna see that no or least company visit, mostly the cs students get good package just because of the reason because the it companies are well and core are least. Secure meters visit for ece and ee, cs again will get edge in it so you can go for off campus as well.. But it feels wasting money here just because core companies visit so less here. Fee structure is damn high.. The fees have gone to a high level again, i would say that a min of 16 lakhs will go on study here. For btech students and hence it is quite high. If the rank is seen then the fee must be feasible but here we will see hyke in fees both hostel and academics evry year.u will definitely think to get a degree from any of normal college where too much money will not be wasted, it comes evry year in mind that the manner in which fees goes so much makes us think again...... College life will be memorable. Hostel food is sumtimes well bt mostly ur money will be wasted for food outside and it sill definitely make ur monthly pay even more. Try to cope up with situations. And please try to clear all the subjects, one back means 3000rs and without classes rs 500 therefore try to not get backs or debar and be well in studies, try to do sum alternative stuffs so that u will be seen a different human here as it eill distinguish you from others out here. No of students are Acc to me its worth the money,because u will enjoy evry moment, the buildings are quite well maintained leaving our Chanakya which is oldest but as we came in our 3rd year, the building also got maintained and therefore all the buildings now are well. I would say you will enjoy hostel life leaving its food. U will waste much money each month and at end it will come to mind how to manage the money. If u r in love here please try to cope up because 2x money will be laid during those moments.thnks."
A outstanding infrastructure of college with having some beautiful view from the college. Mountain of mussoorie seems beautiful and the buildingz ofbthe college very nice and good and well maintained here. Good and well experienced teachers a good curriculum is designed here for the students but their is not a good labs for the students but we call it a average labs facility are given here . And a well maintained and good technicians are also. Altough a good record of placement here . But there package is not exceeds nore than 25 lac. Also the average package is aroung 6 to 7 lac. But although a worth college for the students who is doing his graduation. Good I love my college and happy for being part of this college
"Infrastructure is good. Here u will get the sufficient equipments for everything like sports and other activities. Cricketers are provided with their kits.... common for a team. Same case for other sports team also. You will also be provided your own name jersey in diff. Sports. Falculty is good anyway. There are teachers who will always help you out in your studies and also in your personal matters if you did like to share with them but there are few who doesn't cares about you and your future a lot . Placements are good for CSE department students and average is around 3.5 lacs per annum is considered good as a beginner. nearly which. But placements for other branch students are not so good and they have to trouble a lot for that If you just wanna pay the BTech fees over here, it's nearly 2.26 lacs for 1st year , 2.5 lacs for 2nd year, 2.65 for 3rd year and 2.75 for final year if you are from CSE department in this college which is the most in this college. Fees is little bit more as compared to other colleges in UK. Campus life over here is so good. If you are a hostler then you must be enjoying the college life at its fullest as the environment is very playful and joyful. You will never miss the sunsets over here if you are obsessed with it. Overall the college is good if you study overhere and you will surely get paid for that. If you top in your class, then you will be provided scholarship which is good , which motivates every student to study. Girls toppers are also provided scholarship from each class"
"In the lap of mountains filled with greenery DIT University is one of most prestigious colleges in Uttrakhand.It comprises of all facilities that a proper college campus should have whether its cafeteria, amphitheater, variety of sports and etc. Talking about classrooms it also serves with proper teaching equipments i.e.,smart boards and other basic things. Last but not least Hostels are home away from home which serves good food and proper accommodation according to our needs. I am a student of B.Tech 3rd year from Computer Science.Seeing the future scope and exposure to outside world I opted for Computer Science Engineering. The curriculum is upto date including the present happenings in outside world regarding latest developments and achievements in CS department helping each and every student job ready. Placements play a major role in choosing colleges. But DIT University in this context has been upto the mark since the day I joined the college. Listening from seniors talk last year almost 95percent students got placed with flying colors and a handsome salary. Average salary was around 5LPA which is not a bad start to a career. Various types of courses are offered here. Although mine is Core CS but we also have collaboration with IT giants like IBM and Oracle which provides depth in choosing. For core cost per year is around 3 lacs including hostel but for collaborative its around 4 lacs. A wonderful place to spend the important 4 years of your life with full of adventures, enthusiasm,fun and lot more to be explored within the time period. Come and experience it with your own experience."
"The infrastructure of the dit university have all the necessary infrastructure, facilities for their staff as well as for students. The classrooms and the laboratories are well maintained. But their is lack of facilities for the sports. There is only single playing area which is in the boys hostel. But this university deserves 5 rating for cleanliness and hygiene as the environment near the dit university is extremely well so it is best as per the infrastructure and cleanliness. I am the student of B.tech in Computer science and engineering. I am a 2nd year student and have interest in programming. As far I have seen the professors at dit university are good and provide you the quality content for university exams as well as for other competitive exams. Some of the facilities are the best and always encourage students as per their interest and passion. As it is the private university so here comes it's benifit that the curriculum is updated with latest technologies The placement in dit university is enhancing day by day. The average package is 4.5 lakhs per annum and the highest package is 25 lakhs pee annum. In cs department the placement is around 90% (maximum) and the highest as compared to other departments. Dit university is very supportive regarding the placement as they help each and every student to improve their skills and help them to find the better options for them. Computer science in dit university costs around 2-3 lakhs per annum. It's high as compared to some colleges but I think it's worth. As they provide all the facilities and take actions actively. And at the end maximum students get placed and from my point of you that this is why we are going to the college. The campus life is very nice at the dit university. Students can engage in cultural activities sports and other technical events. There are so many clubs and you can join them as per your interest. The students and the facilities in the dit university are very helpful and they always help you . The dit university is located in makka wala and near to musafir which make the environment and the view moat beautiful and you will feel so pleasant.

"DIT University Dehradun has one of the best infrastructure in Dehradun. Compared to other Universities it has building named Vastu, vendanta, chanakya. Hostel facility is also available. It has a vast campus. My college has a great faculty and academic structure. Faculty improves us on daily task and academics. We all have to abide the rules. Supplementary courses are also available like french , some training and development class are scheduled for the students on regular basis Above average placed are seen college. Students get places in MNC's each year. Packages starts during kid November in second year. Some students got placed in 3 different companies while they have to choose one! First year course costs about 1.5 lakhs. Total course costs about 3.8 lakhs, which also includes factory visits and some extra curricular activities! Indoor games, well maintained canteen and Atmosphere of the college is very good."
"The college infrastructure is excellent. College provides all the facility to the students.The classes are well maintained and have all the necessary things projector, Good and hygiene sound observer etc.Everything is well maintained and taken proper Maintenance is taken.The hostel has common room where you can watch match as TV is there.Hostel is clean and hygiene. Proper cleaning is done each and every day. The academics is excellent.The professor are very nice and friendly. I am biotech civil student we have an excellent lab and have all the equipment. The faculty are very supportive and help in everything. We have seminars and workshop related to over field which is very helpful and curriculum is totally updated. Placement is very poor when compared to other branches in dit.The placement scenario of civil is very low.The college is overall supportive and is trying to convince company to recruit the civil students.Whereas some of student has also got places that is 2 out 100. My course cost 3 lakh per year.I feel my getting my money worth on average as the academics is good but the placement is weak.so you should try to prepare for gate examination and other higher examination and also try to get placement offline.But academically the I am getting my money worth. The campus life is excellent the college is between the hills of Missouri so the atmosphere is excellent and you feel very relax here.The student can engage in many extra curricular activities. It has collaboration with max hospital so in case you become I'll there is proper treatment for you. Overall college is good for civil but placement is weak."
"Yes, it has all necessary facilities available. Environment is so pleasant and clean. Wifi has high speed internet access. Hostel and mess facilities are good enough. Surrounding is so satisfactory here. Department of Computer Science is awesome here. Syllabus is well updated. teachers are teaching well, they are able to clear the doubts that arise when they lectures. I felt the classes interesting, but there are some students who doesnt understands the class because they are indulged in the mobile phones. The curriculum is not updated and is of the past years. Quality of placement is very good here. placement is pretty good for my branch which is the computer science engineering. We have a good placement among all other branches of the college. There is also some good companies visiting our college for campus placement. My course cost 2 lakhs per year. It is worth it for all the facilities and faculties available. Awesome Campus life, surrounded with green mountains. DIT University is a great place to study Engineering."
"The college has overall great views at all around because it is located in foothills of Mussorie. So, whenever there is a cloudy day you can't stop yourself to capture the landscape. Now talking about the academics as the labs are well equipped but there is lack of proper academic calender and also there is lack faculty in the department for the different subjects. Also all the academic buildings are equipped with good wifi network. All the campus building are clean surroundings. I am pursuing my BTECH in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Automobile Engineering is good but here the faculty&amp;labs not available for various optional subjects which we wanted to learn in the last semesters. The quality of placement for mechanical branch is almost zero percent. Out of 100students 1 or 3 gets placed.The ratio of placement for mechanical branch is very less.All you need to do is to improve your academic and look for out campus. The course cost approx 2.5 lakh per year.If you look at academic It's totally value for money but if your need is placement than you will not get the worth of your money.Very few companies visit for hiring Mechanical and Automobile Engineering students. Yeah the money which I spent is worth for doing this course. The overall campus life is good. As, here we celebrate different festivals with great enthusiasm under college faculty guidelines. Different events also organised by students such as Youthopia which is annual cultural and technical fest and lots of small events which are organised by students of different courses. The overall experience at this college was good for me till now. Initially when I came to this college at that time the management was good but now I'm in 3 year and at this time management was not so good. Hope they will recover there system back ."
"Good, can be improved, some of the classes lack the projector facility otherwise the classes are good, and talking about Infrastructure it is absolutely fine and one can surely work on them, electronics are also in good condition. Satisfying, I am an Engineering student from Cse 3rd year, and I have a interest in tech and the faculty here is good, they always try to help us in one or other ways. The curriculum is fine but sometimes there are too, unnecessary things to do. Need more companies, the placement ratio is good over the years, but also in recent years there has been a crackdown in the ratio. The highest package last year was around 16 to 20 LPA. The average is around 4.5 LPA. Expensive though, the fee is quite high, my course cost me around or above 2 Lakh, it depends on the working of students whether they get there worth or not, for me I totally think I'm not getting it, because I have come with many more dreams which college fails to provide support for. Good, it is fine, the best features are, we have good space to hang around, and a good library to sit and have some self study. The support staff depends person by person some teachers always try to help, while some don't. Fine"
"Yes,the college have all the facilities and infrastructure and equipment every branch lab has all the facilities to perform lab work.The classrooms are have projector and sound observer which helps students to hear facilities nicely .They have been taken very good care with proper maintenance.The college,hostel and college campus is totally clean and food are also hyegnic I am btech cse student i got suggestions from my seniors that the college have very nice academic and the placement senario for cse is very nice.The curriculum is updated and the student are made aware of all the new technology and research .The CDC helps your to get ready for the placment and make you job ready. The quality of placment for computer science is excellent.Where as it is less in other branches and approx very less in petro,ee,civil.The highest sallary offered is 22 lakh for cse student and for petroleum student was also same but to very less.The sallary offered average is 4 lakh.The college is very supportive. It costed approx 3 lakh per year.There are many collaboration courses in dit you can choose them.They are from IBM,ORCAL etc their fees is higer but is beneficial for future.I feel if you get placed you will get your money worth try to do best in 4 year of course and get your money worth.Even i feel my money worth. The campus life is very nice it is near by mussorie and has excellent atmosphere.There are many club in college where you can get involved.The student gets very nice teacher as well as supportive staff.The Problem is that you will not get a bus auto anything to come college after 7 pm for that you need private vechile.But overall everything is good and can handle all emergency. Give your best in the 4 year of degree and you will achieve everything you want."
"The college have all the necessary infrastructure, facilities and equipment.Each and every branch have well equipped equipment which are necessary for practical that need to be performed while course.The college have smart boards the library are very big and have all the used book.The sports facilities is little weak.Where as the hostel and college leaving space are clean and hygienic. I am a student of btech CSE student and i get to know from my senior about the college.The academic of college is very good in comparison to other college of Dehradun.The curriculum is upto date.Students are made aware of the new opportunities by the faculty.If u give your 100 percent it will make you job ready. The quality of placement is good in computer science .The placement scenario of ece is good but the placement of other branches is very bad.The computer science students almost get all placed try to don't have any back logs till last sem.The average sallary is approx 4 lakh for CSE student but other branches it can be sure. The course cost per year is approx 3 lakh.If you want best academic you can choose this college and placement for CSE is also good.Hence if your motive is to get placement than you must choose CSE and you will get the value of money .I am in CSE and i fill i am getting value for my money. The college campus has very good life.The best is atmosphere and the worst is the college don't have a play ground . Student can engage them in various club.The student,staff as well as faculty are very supportive and helpful. Choose the college fort cse .It is best for cse course other than any branches."
"The infrastructure of the college is just awesome and should be appreciated to the architectures. I am going to describe this in few points. Firstly the color of dit university is don't having different color in different building a cemented brown premium color finish on all the building all around the glimpse of the musssorie mountain and having a beautiful Indian flag in the center of it in a garden. Dit university is comprises of having lifts,labs,automatic cleaning machines,smart light. I am studying BTECH in electronics and communication and i am very well satisfied with the academics of DIT as it syllabus related to CBCS Scheme the load of the syllabus is little high but the person with dedication and do it easily. Though the support of highly educated faculties and course notes access online. In the end of every semester they take a review from us about the course what difficulties we faced in it. The person having a maintained good CGPA around 7.5 or above can easily get a good placements in the listed companies like- INFOSYS, INFOTECH, HCL ,HP, WIPRO , REALINCE, JIO, AIRTEL ,VODAPHONE AND MANY MORE Multinational Companies. Just focus and studies and academics and you'll easily get a good placement above 6.5lac and higher upto 2.1cr I think a little bit higher charges of fees is not value for money as charging 2lac per annum is quite high it should be around 1.4lac so then it might be better and good for the students. Every course has differnet structures of fees and very costly above 1 lac each semester. Overall experience is good and enjoying in the campus as the timings and breaks of the lecture is good we get a lot of time of enjoyment and studies as well and also get extra curricular activities like club and social programs that is also necessary for students. We love DIT for this. 10/9 1 marks for the fees that is quite high that should be maintained or some entrance exam based scholarship for the students might be a good option to overcome this."
"I am satisfied about my college infrastructure and it is so clean and well maintained , if i am telling about my block it just very beautiful and the way they had that hygienic , they had the very well living spaces means hostels. Academics is good not so bed if i am telling about computer science in it department we have too much opportunity and platforms are good also teacher are good but the sometime they don;t come on the time , another they well qualified. Placements are good in computer science department but not in all departments so i am lucky that i have computer science and engineering department and i am happy to take the placement schedule over there. It is not too much costly per year over there , They help to students and give the loan if the students are not able to pay that much so that means they have own bank formalities and i feel that my course is money's worthy. over there if i am telling about campus life it is fantabulous and the overall campus has own beauty and the campus is very good background space over there so that means the whole campus has beautiful view. The overall campus has own beauty in the manner of academy and about the placement and the infrastructure and the main thing is library is so good they give us books to read for 15 days on once issue,"
The infrastructure is quite good and well maintained and has nearly all of the facilities required in a university and also have gyms both for girls and boys separate. The tuck shops are also good and you'll find things necessary for yourself easily. The professor are quite helpful and help a lot with your academics and also help with your projects and also recommend what are the things that you need to do for completing the course and also what you should do to get a good placement There are companies coming to the campus and also the campus provides a good number of opportunities for getting well placed it all depends on you how you use the opportunities provided by them otherwise if you even study in IIT you'll end up landing nowhere. The campus life is very good.

"I joined DIT University in the year 2018.The infrastructure of the college is well maintained. Washrooms facilities in some buildings could be better. Labs are well organized and maintained. Libraries are quite good. E - books facilities are also available in the libraries, computer's section is also well equipped. Hostel food is bearable. The best part is college WiFi. Overall the environment is peaceful and positive. The location is extremely good surrounded by the beautiful view of hills. I am pursuing BA (Hons.) English. I always wanted to study about English language and literature in depth. The university follows the UGC guidelines so everything is carefully taken care of. Syllabus is updated timely. Faculties are extremely helpful, kind and friendly. Proper guidance and exercises that we practice do make us job ready. It helps in shaping the base. Though there are some area of improvements and they need to work on them. University offers a wide range of placements opportunities. They also organize sessions to help us being ready for the interviews and placement activities. The highest salary package was offered to an economic honours student that was approx 12 lakhsperannum. Mostly students who worked hard on themselves get placed.I have no idea about the how the placement process takes place because I haven't gotten chance to sit for it as I am in second year. The university is supportive. My course cost around 80 thousands per year. I do feel that my parents money is getting used properly. The university provides us with almost everything that we want. Facilities are quite good and faculties are helpful. The environment is quite peaceful and positive. The best part is location. Beautiful place. Faculties are hard working. They do work hard on each and every student. They are really supportive. Teaching quality is impressive as well and ample of opportunities to explore oneself. University campus is beautiful. It is well maintained and clean. The view is impressive and eye catching. There are many groups and activities in which a student can take part and explore oneself. The campus is safe. Faculties and other staff members are kind and helpful. Discipline is maintained. well i would say the university is quite good but it can get better. My batch was the first batch so we do faced some difficulties. For my course it is a good option but not the best. As somewhere i feel it could get better."

The college is good in all field as per my view."
"Nyc environment and great view. The place is itself worth evrytime to be just because of its location. Mussorie is 22 kms away and the new cafeteria adds the beauty in the overall. The rating here for view and beauty is 10/10 There are some of good teachers for which iam gonna say the academics are well. Just for the sake i would say mostly it depends upn you whether u want to study or not. Distractions are much, if u smoke weed and other stuffs then u r gonna waste ample of time here,else if u are focused u can do well in xams. There is time to do more courses which u can do or other research works with teachers, and hence only the mid terms happening in each sem, than the end term makes the fever of xams high...... Its getting better day by day. Core companies are less, if you are from cs or it than placement scenario is quite well, else for PE ece or ee mech, u are gonna see that no or least company visit, mostly the cs students get good package just because of the reason because the it companies are well and core are least. Secure meters visit for ece and ee, cs again will get edge in it so you can go for off campus as well.. But it feels wasting money here just because core companies visit so less here. Fee structure is damn high.. The fees have gone to a high level again, i would say that a min of 16 lakhs will go on study here. For btech students and hence it is quite high. If the rank is seen then the fee must be feasible but here we will see hyke in fees both hostel and academics evry year.u will definitely think to get a degree from any of normal college where too much money will not be wasted, it comes evry year in mind that the manner in which fees goes so much makes us think again...... College life will be memorable. Hostel food is sumtimes well bt mostly ur money will be wasted for food outside and it sill definitely make ur monthly pay even more. Try to cope up with situations. And please try to clear all the subjects, one back means 3000rs and without classes rs 500 therefore try to not get backs or debar and be well in studies, try to do sum alternative stuffs so that u will be seen a different human here as it eill distinguish you from others out here. No of students are Acc to me its worth the money,because u will enjoy evry moment, the buildings are quite well maintained leaving our Chanakya which is oldest but as we came in our 3rd year, the building also got maintained and therefore all the buildings now are well. I would say you will enjoy hostel life leaving its food. U will waste much money each month and at end it will come to mind how to manage the money. If u r in love here please try to cope up because 2x money will be laid during those moments.thnks."
A outstanding infrastructure of college with having some beautiful view from the college. Mountain of mussoorie seems beautiful and the buildingz ofbthe college very nice and good and well maintained here. Good and well experienced teachers a good curriculum is designed here for the students but their is not a good labs for the students but we call it a average labs facility are given here . And a well maintained and good technicians are also. Altough a good record of placement here . But there package is not exceeds nore than 25 lac. Also the average package is aroung 6 to 7 lac. But although a worth college for the students who is doing his graduation. Good I love my college and happy for being part of this college
"Infrastructure is good. Here u will get the sufficient equipments for everything like sports and other activities. Cricketers are provided with their kits.... common for a team. Same case for other sports team also. You will also be provided your own name jersey in diff. Sports. Falculty is good anyway. There are teachers who will always help you out in your studies and also in your personal matters if you did like to share with them but there are few who doesn't cares about you and your future a lot . Placements are good for CSE department students and average is around 3.5 lacs per annum is considered good as a beginner. nearly which. But placements for other branch students are not so good and they have to trouble a lot for that If you just wanna pay the BTech fees over here, it's nearly 2.26 lacs for 1st year , 2.5 lacs for 2nd year, 2.65 for 3rd year and 2.75 for final year if you are from CSE department in this college which is the most in this college.

Overall the college is good if you study overhere and you will surely get paid for that.

"In the lap of mountains filled with greenery DIT University is one of most prestigious colleges in Uttrakhand.It comprises of all facilities that a proper college campus should have whether its cafeteria, amphitheater, variety of sports and etc. Talking about classrooms it also serves with proper teaching equipments i.e.,smart boards and other basic things. Last but not least Hostels are home away from home which serves good food and proper accommodation according to our needs. I am a student of B.Tech 3rd year from Computer Science.Seeing the future scope and exposure to outside world I opted for Computer Science Engineering. The curriculum is upto date including the present happenings in outside world regarding latest developments and achievements in CS department helping each and every student job ready. Placements play a major role in choosing colleges. But DIT University in this context has been upto the mark since the day I joined the college. Listening from seniors talk last year almost 95percent students got placed with flying colors and a handsome salary. Average salary was around 5LPA which is not a bad start to a career. Various types of courses are offered here. Although mine is Core CS but we also have collaboration with IT giants like IBM and Oracle which provides depth in choosing. For core cost per year is around 3 lacs including hostel but for collaborative its around 4 lacs. A wonderful place to spend the important 4 years of your life with full of adventures, enthusiasm,fun and lot more to be explored within the time period. Come and experience it with your own experience."
"The infrastructure of the dit university have all the necessary infrastructure, facilities for their staff as well as for students. The classrooms and the laboratories are well maintained. But their is lack of facilities for the sports. There is only single playing area which is in the boys hostel. But this university deserves 5 rating for cleanliness and hygiene as the environment near the dit university is extremely well so it is best as per the infrastructure and cleanliness. I am the student of B.tech in Computer science and engineering. I am a 2nd year student and have interest in programming. As far I have seen the professors at dit university are good and provide you the quality content for university exams as well as for other competitive exams. Some of the facilities are the best and always encourage students as per their interest and passion. As it is the private university so here comes it's benifit that the curriculum is updated with latest technologies The placement in dit university is enhancing day by day. The average package is 4.5 lakhs per annum and the highest package is 25 lakhs pee annum. In cs department the placement is around 90% (maximum) and the highest as compared to other departments. Dit university is very supportive regarding the placement as they help each and every student to improve their skills and help them to find the better options for them. Computer science in dit university costs around 2-3 lakhs per annum. It's high as compared to some colleges but I think it's worth. As they provide all the facilities and take actions actively. And at the end maximum students get placed and from my point of you that this is why we are going to the college. The campus life is very nice at the dit university. Students can engage in cultural activities sports and other technical events. There are so many clubs and you can join them as per your interest. The students and the facilities in the dit university are very helpful and they always help you . The dit university is located in makka wala and near to musafir which make the environment and the view moat beautiful and you will feel so pleasant. They can handle emergencies as there is max hospital."

Indoor games, well maintained canteen and Atmosphere of the college is very good."

Placement is very poor when compared to other branches in dit.The placement scenario of civil is very low.The college is overall supportive and is trying to convince company to recruit the civil students.Whereas some of student has also got places that is 2 out 100. My course cost 3 lakh per year.I feel my getting my money worth on average as the academics is good but the placement is weak.so you should try to prepare for gate examination and other higher examination and also try to get placement offline.But academically the I am getting my money worth. The campus life is excellent the college is between the hills of Missouri so the atmosphere is excellent and you feel very relax here.The student can engage in many extra curricular activities.

"Yes, it has all necessary facilities available. Environment is so pleasant and clean. Wifi has high speed internet access. Hostel and mess facilities are good enough. Surrounding is so satisfactory here. Department of Computer Science is awesome here. Syllabus is well updated. teachers are teaching well, they are able to clear the doubts that arise when they lectures. I felt the classes interesting, but there are some students who doesnt understands the class because they are indulged in the mobile phones. The curriculum is not updated and is of the past years. Quality of placement is very good here. placement is pretty good for my branch which is the computer science engineering. We have a good placement among all other branches of the college. There is also some good companies visiting our college for campus placement. My course cost 2 lakhs per year. It is worth it for all the facilities and faculties available. Awesome Campus life, surrounded with green mountains. DIT University is a great place to study Engineering."
"The college has overall great views at all around because it is located in foothills of Mussorie. So, whenever there is a cloudy day you can't stop yourself to capture the landscape. Now talking about the academics as the labs are well equipped but there is lack of proper academic calender and also there is lack faculty in the department for the different subjects. Also all the academic buildings are equipped with good wifi network. All the campus building are clean surroundings. I am pursuing my BTECH in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Automobile Engineering is good but here the faculty&amp;labs not available for various optional subjects which we wanted to learn in the last semesters. The quality of placement for mechanical branch is almost zero percent. Out of 100students 1 or 3 gets placed.The ratio of placement for mechanical branch is very less.All you need to do is to improve your academic and look for out campus. The course cost approx 2.5 lakh per year.If you look at academic It's totally value for money but if your need is placement than you will not get the worth of your money.Very few companies visit for hiring Mechanical and Automobile Engineering students. Yeah the money which I spent is worth for doing this course. The overall campus life is good. As, here we celebrate different festivals with great enthusiasm under college faculty guidelines. Different events also organised by students such as Youthopia which is annual cultural and technical fest and lots of small events which are organised by students of different courses. The overall experience at this college was good for me till now. Initially when I came to this college at that time the management was good but now I'm in 3 year and at this time management was not so good. Hope they will recover there system back ."
"Good, can be improved, some of the classes lack the projector facility otherwise the classes are good, and talking about Infrastructure it is absolutely fine and one can surely work on them, electronics are also in good condition. Satisfying, I am an Engineering student from Cse 3rd year, and I have a interest in tech and the faculty here is good, they always try to help us in one or other ways. The curriculum is fine but sometimes there are too, unnecessary things to do. Need more companies, the placement ratio is good over the years, but also in recent years there has been a crackdown in the ratio. The highest package last year was around 16 to 20 LPA. The average is around 4.5 LPA. Expensive though, the fee is quite high, my course cost me around or above 2 Lakh, it depends on the working of students whether they get there worth or not, for me I totally think I'm not getting it, because I have come with many more dreams which college fails to provide support for. Good, it is fine, the best features are, we have good space to hang around, and a good library to sit and have some self study. The support staff depends person by person some teachers always try to help, while some don't. Fine"
"Yes,the college have all the facilities and infrastructure and equipment every branch lab has all the facilities to perform lab work.The classrooms are have projector and sound observer which helps students to hear facilities nicely .They have been taken very good care with proper maintenance.The college,hostel and college campus is totally clean and food are also hyegnic I am btech cse student i got suggestions from my seniors that the college have very nice academic and the placement senario for cse is very nice.The curriculum is updated and the student are made aware of all the new technology and research .The CDC helps your to get ready for the placment and make you job ready. The quality of placment for computer science is excellent.Where as it is less in other branches and approx very less in petro,ee,civil.The highest sallary offered is 22 lakh for cse student and for petroleum student was also same but to very less.The sallary offered average is 4 lakh.The college is very supportive. It costed approx 3 lakh per year.There are many collaboration courses in dit you can choose them.They are from IBM,ORCAL etc their fees is higer but is beneficial for future.I feel if you get placed you will get your money worth try to do best in 4 year of course and get your money worth.Even i feel my money worth. The campus life is very nice it is near by mussorie and has excellent atmosphere.There are many club in college where you can get involved.The student gets very nice teacher as well as supportive staff.The Problem is that you will not get a bus auto anything to come college after 7 pm for that you need private vechile.But overall everything is good and can handle all emergency. Give your best in the 4 year of degree and you will achieve everything you want."
"The college have all the necessary infrastructure, facilities and equipment.Each and every branch have well equipped equipment which are necessary for practical that need to be performed while course.The college have smart boards the library are very big and have all the used book.The sports facilities is little weak.Where as the hostel and college leaving space are clean and hygienic.

The course cost per year is approx 3 lakh.If you want best academic you can choose this college and placement for CSE is also good.Hence if your motive is to get placement than you must choose CSE and you will get the value of money .I am in CSE and i fill i am getting value for my money. The college campus has very good life.The best is atmosphere and the worst is the college don't have a play ground . Student can engage them in various club.The student,staff as well as faculty are very supportive and helpful. Choose the college fort cse .It is best for cse course other than any branches."
"The infrastructure of the college is just awesome and should be appreciated to the architectures. I am going to describe this in few points. Firstly the color of dit university is don't having different color in different building a cemented brown premium color finish on all the building all around the glimpse of the musssorie mountain and having a beautiful Indian flag in the center of it in a garden. Dit university is comprises of having lifts,labs,automatic cleaning machines,smart light. I am studying BTECH in electronics and communication and i am very well satisfied with the academics of DIT as it syllabus related to CBCS Scheme the load of the syllabus is little high but the person with dedication and do it easily. Though the support of highly educated faculties and course notes access online. In the end of every semester they take a review from us about the course what difficulties we faced in it. The person having a maintained good CGPA around 7.5 or above can easily get a good placements in the listed companies like- INFOSYS, INFOTECH, HCL ,HP, WIPRO , REALINCE, JIO, AIRTEL ,VODAPHONE AND MANY MORE Multinational Companies. Just focus and studies and academics and you'll easily get a good placement above 6.5lac and higher upto 2.1cr I think a little bit higher charges of fees is not value for money as charging 2lac per annum is quite high it should be around 1.4lac so then it might be better and good for the students. Every course has differnet structures of fees and very costly above 1 lac each semester. Overall experience is good and enjoying in the campus as the timings and breaks of the lecture is good we get a lot of time of enjoyment and studies as well and also get extra curricular activities like club and social programs that is also necessary for students. We love DIT for this. 10/9 1 marks for the fees that is quite high that should be maintained or some entrance exam based scholarship for the students might be a good option to overcome this."
"I am satisfied about my college infrastructure and it is so clean and well maintained , if i am telling about my block it just very beautiful and the way they had that hygienic , they had the very well living spaces means hostels. Academics is good not so bed if i am telling about computer science in it department we have too much opportunity and platforms are good also teacher are good but the sometime they don;t come on the time , another they well qualified. Placements are good in computer science department but not in all departments so i am lucky that i have computer science and engineering department and i am happy to take the placement schedule over there. It is not too much costly per year over there , They help to students and give the loan if the students are not able to pay that much so that means they have own bank formalities and i feel that my course is money's worthy. over there if i am telling about campus life it is fantabulous and the overall campus has own beauty and the campus is very good background space over there so that means the whole campus has beautiful view. The overall campus has own beauty in the manner of academy and about the placement and the infrastructure and the main thing is library is so good they give us books to read for 15 days on once issue,"
The infrastructure is quite good and well maintained and has nearly all of the facilities required in a university and also have gyms both for girls and boys separate. The tuck shops are also good and you'll find things necessary for yourself easily. The professor are quite helpful and help a lot with your academics and also help with your projects and also recommend what are the things that you need to do for completing the course and also what you should do to get a good placement There are companies coming to the campus and also the campus provides a good number of opportunities for getting well placed it all depends on you how you use the opportunities provided by them otherwise if you even study in IIT you'll end up landing nowhere. The campus life is very good.

The weather is always pleasant. The staff and teachers are very supportive. It has collabration with maxx hospital so healt wise it is also safe.Yes it can handle all emergencies. The college is good in all field as per my view."
"Nyc environment and great view. The place is itself worth evrytime to be just because of its location. Mussorie is 22 kms away and the new cafeteria adds the beauty in the overall. The rating here for view and beauty is 10/10 There are some of good teachers for which iam gonna say the academics are well. Just for the sake i would say mostly it depends upn you whether u want to study or not. Distractions are much, if u smoke weed and other stuffs then u r gonna waste ample of time here,else if u are focused u can do well in xams. There is time to do more courses which u can do or other research works with teachers, and hence only the mid terms happening in each sem, than the end term makes the fever of xams high...... Its getting better day by day. Core companies are less, if you are from cs or it than placement scenario is quite well, else for PE ece or ee mech, u are gonna see that no or least company visit, mostly the cs students get good package just because of the reason because the it companies are well and core are least. Secure meters visit for ece and ee, cs again will get edge in it so you can go for off campus as well.. But it feels wasting money here just because core companies visit so less here. Fee structure is damn high.. The fees have gone to a high level again, i would say that a min of 16 lakhs will go on study here. For btech students and hence it is quite high. If the rank is seen then the fee must be feasible but here we will see hyke in fees both hostel and academics evry year.u will definitely think to get a degree from any of normal college where too much money will not be wasted, it comes evry year in mind that the manner in which fees goes so much makes us think again...... College life will be memorable. Hostel food is sumtimes well bt mostly ur money will be wasted for food outside and it sill definitely make ur monthly pay even more. Try to cope up with situations. And please try to clear all the subjects, one back means 3000rs and without classes rs 500 therefore try to not get backs or debar and be well in studies, try to do sum alternative stuffs so that u will be seen a different human here as it eill distinguish you from others out here. No of students are Acc to me its worth the money,because u will enjoy evry moment, the buildings are quite well maintained leaving our Chanakya which is oldest but as we came in our 3rd year, the building also got maintained and therefore all the buildings now are well. I would say you will enjoy hostel life leaving its food. U will waste much money each month and at end it will come to mind how to manage the money. If u r in love here please try to cope up because 2x money will be laid during those moments.thnks."
A outstanding infrastructure of college with having some beautiful view from the college. Mountain of mussoorie seems beautiful and the buildingz ofbthe college very nice and good and well maintained here. Good and well experienced teachers a good curriculum is designed here for the students but their is not a good labs for the students but we call it a average labs facility are given here . And a well maintained and good technicians are also. Altough a good record of placement here . But there package is not exceeds nore than 25 lac. Also the average package is aroung 6 to 7 lac. But although a worth college for the students who is doing his graduation. Good I love my college and happy for being part of this college
"Infrastructure is good. Here u will get the sufficient equipments for everything like sports and other activities. Cricketers are provided with their kits.... common for a team. Same case for other sports team also. You will also be provided your own name jersey in diff. Sports. Falculty is good anyway. There are teachers who will always help you out in your studies and also in your personal matters if you did like to share with them but there are few who doesn't cares about you and your future a lot . Placements are good for CSE department students and average is around 3.5 lacs per annum is considered good as a beginner. nearly which. But placements for other branch students are not so good and they have to trouble a lot for that If you just wanna pay the BTech fees over here, it's nearly 2.26 lacs for 1st year , 2.5 lacs for 2nd year, 2.65 for 3rd year and 2.75 for final year if you are from CSE department in this college which is the most in this college. Fees is little bit more as compared to other colleges in UK. Campus life over here is so good. If you are a hostler then you must be enjoying the college life at its fullest as the environment is very playful and joyful. You will never miss the sunsets over here if you are obsessed with it. Overall the college is good if you study overhere and you will surely get paid for that. If you top in your class, then you will be provided scholarship which is good , which motivates every student to study. Girls toppers are also provided scholarship from each class"
"In the lap of mountains filled with greenery DIT University is one of most prestigious colleges in Uttrakhand.It comprises of all facilities that a proper college campus should have whether its cafeteria, amphitheater, variety of sports and etc. Talking about classrooms it also serves with proper teaching equipments i.e.,smart boards and other basic things. Last but not least Hostels are home away from home which serves good food and proper accommodation according to our needs. I am a student of B.Tech 3rd year from Computer Science.Seeing the future scope and exposure to outside world I opted for Computer Science Engineering. The curriculum is upto date including the present happenings in outside world regarding latest developments and achievements in CS department helping each and every student job ready. Placements play a major role in choosing colleges. But DIT University in this context has been upto the mark since the day I joined the college. Listening from seniors talk last year almost 95percent students got placed with flying colors and a handsome salary. Average salary was around 5LPA which is not a bad start to a career. Various types of courses are offered here. Although mine is Core CS but we also have collaboration with IT giants like IBM and Oracle which provides depth in choosing. For core cost per year is around 3 lacs including hostel but for collaborative its around 4 lacs. A wonderful place to spend the important 4 years of your life with full of adventures, enthusiasm,fun and lot more to be explored within the time period. Come and experience it with your own experience."
"The infrastructure of the dit university have all the necessary infrastructure, facilities for their staff as well as for students. The classrooms and the laboratories are well maintained. But their is lack of facilities for the sports. There is only single playing area which is in the boys hostel. But this university deserves 5 rating for cleanliness and hygiene as the environment near the dit university is extremely well so it is best as per the infrastructure and cleanliness. I am the student of B.tech in Computer science and engineering. I am a 2nd year student and have interest in programming. As far I have seen the professors at dit university are good and provide you the quality content for university exams as well as for other competitive exams. Some of the facilities are the best and always encourage students as per their interest and passion. As it is the private university so here comes it's benifit that the curriculum is updated with latest technologies The placement in dit university is enhancing day by day. The average package is 4.5 lakhs per annum and the highest package is 25 lakhs pee annum. In cs department the placement is around 90% (maximum) and the highest as compared to other departments. Dit university is very supportive regarding the placement as they help each and every student to improve their skills and help them to find the better options for them. Computer science in dit university costs around 2-3 lakhs per annum. It's high as compared to some colleges but I think it's worth. As they provide all the facilities and take actions actively. And at the end maximum students get placed and from my point of you that this is why we are going to the college. The campus life is very nice at the dit university. Students can engage in cultural activities sports and other technical events. There are so many clubs and you can join them as per your interest. The students and the facilities in the dit university are very helpful and they always help you . The dit university is located in makka wala and near to musafir which make the environment and the view moat beautiful and you will feel so pleasant. They can handle emergencies as there is max hospital."

"DIT University Dehradun has one of the best infrastructure in Dehradun. Compared to other Universities it has building named Vastu, vendanta, chanakya. Hostel facility is also available. It has a vast campus. My college has a great faculty and academic structure. Faculty improves us on daily task and academics. We all have to abide the rules. Supplementary courses are also available like french , some training and development class are scheduled for the students on regular basis Above average placed are seen college. Students get places in MNC's each year. Packages starts during kid November in second year. Some students got placed in 3 different companies while they have to choose one! First year course costs about 1.5 lakhs. Total course costs about 3.8 lakhs, which also includes factory visits and some extra curricular activities! Indoor games, well maintained canteen and Atmosphere of the college is very good."
"The college infrastructure is excellent. College provides all the facility to the students.The classes are well maintained and have all the necessary things projector, Good and hygiene sound observer etc.Everything is well maintained and taken proper Maintenance is taken.The hostel has common room where you can watch match as TV is there.Hostel is clean and hygiene. Proper cleaning is done each and every day. The academics is excellent.The professor are very nice and friendly. I am biotech civil student we have an excellent lab and have all the equipment. The faculty are very supportive and help in everything. We have seminars and workshop related to over field which is very helpful and curriculum is totally updated. Placement is very poor when compared to other branches in dit.The placement scenario of civil is very low.The college is overall supportive and is trying to convince company to recruit the civil students.Whereas some of student has also got places that is 2 out 100. My course cost 3 lakh per year.I feel my getting my money worth on average as the academics is good but the placement is weak.so you should try to prepare for gate examination and other higher examination and also try to get placement offline.But academically the I am getting my money worth. The campus life is excellent the college is between the hills of Missouri so the atmosphere is excellent and you feel very relax here.The student can engage in many extra curricular activities. It has collaboration with max hospital so in case you become I'll there is proper treatment for you. Overall college is good for civil but placement is weak."
"Yes, it has all necessary facilities available. Environment is so pleasant and clean. Wifi has high speed internet access. Hostel and mess facilities are good enough. Surrounding is so satisfactory here. Department of Computer Science is awesome here. Syllabus is well updated. teachers are teaching well, they are able to clear the doubts that arise when they lectures. I felt the classes interesting, but there are some students who doesnt understands the class because they are indulged in the mobile phones. The curriculum is not updated and is of the past years. Quality of placement is very good here. placement is pretty good for my branch which is the computer science engineering. We have a good placement among all other branches of the college. There is also some good companies visiting our college for campus placement. My course cost 2 lakhs per year. It is worth it for all the facilities and faculties available. Awesome Campus life, surrounded with green mountains. DIT University is a great place to study Engineering."
"The college has overall great views at all around because it is located in foothills of Mussorie. So, whenever there is a cloudy day you can't stop yourself to capture the landscape. Now talking about the academics as the labs are well equipped but there is lack of proper academic calender and also there is lack faculty in the department for the different subjects. Also all the academic buildings are equipped with good wifi network. All the campus building are clean surroundings. I am pursuing my BTECH in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Automobile Engineering is good but here the faculty&amp;labs not available for various optional subjects which we wanted to learn in the last semesters. The quality of placement for mechanical branch is almost zero percent. Out of 100students 1 or 3 gets placed.The ratio of placement for mechanical branch is very less.All you need to do is to improve your academic and look for out campus. The course cost approx 2.5 lakh per year.If you look at academic It's totally value for money but if your need is placement than you will not get the worth of your money.Very few companies visit for hiring Mechanical and Automobile Engineering students. Yeah the money which I spent is worth for doing this course. The overall campus life is good. As, here we celebrate different festivals with great enthusiasm under college faculty guidelines. Different events also organised by students such as Youthopia which is annual cultural and technical fest and lots of small events which are organised by students of different courses. The overall experience at this college was good for me till now. Initially when I came to this college at that time the management was good but now I'm in 3 year and at this time management was not so good. Hope they will recover there system back ."
"Good, can be improved, some of the classes lack the projector facility otherwise the classes are good, and talking about Infrastructure it is absolutely fine and one can surely work on them, electronics are also in good condition. Satisfying, I am an Engineering student from Cse 3rd year, and I have a interest in tech and the faculty here is good, they always try to help us in one or other ways. The curriculum is fine but sometimes there are too, unnecessary things to do. Need more companies, the placement ratio is good over the years, but also in recent years there has been a crackdown in the ratio. The highest package last year was around 16 to 20 LPA. The average is around 4.5 LPA. Expensive though, the fee is quite high, my course cost me around or above 2 Lakh, it depends on the working of students whether they get there worth or not, for me I totally think I'm not getting it, because I have come with many more dreams which college fails to provide support for. Good, it is fine, the best features are, we have good space to hang around, and a good library to sit and have some self study. The support staff depends person by person some teachers always try to help, while some don't. Fine"
"Yes,the college have all the facilities and infrastructure and equipment every branch lab has all the facilities to perform lab work.The classrooms are have projector and sound observer which helps students to hear facilities nicely .They have been taken very good care with proper maintenance.The college,hostel and college campus is totally clean and food are also hyegnic I am btech cse student i got suggestions from my seniors that the college have very nice academic and the placement senario for cse is very nice.The curriculum is updated and the student are made aware of all the new technology and research .The CDC helps your to get ready for the placment and make you job ready. The quality of placment for computer science is excellent.Where as it is less in other branches and approx very less in petro,ee,civil.The highest sallary offered is 22 lakh for cse student and for petroleum student was also same but to very less.The sallary offered average is 4 lakh.The college is very supportive. It costed approx 3 lakh per year.There are many collaboration courses in dit you can choose them.They are from IBM,ORCAL etc their fees is higer but is beneficial for future.I feel if you get placed you will get your money worth try to do best in 4 year of course and get your money worth.Even i feel my money worth. The campus life is very nice it is near by mussorie and has excellent atmosphere.There are many club in college where you can get involved.The student gets very nice teacher as well as supportive staff.The Problem is that you will not get a bus auto anything to come college after 7 pm for that you need private vechile.But overall everything is good and can handle all emergency. Give your best in the 4 year of degree and you will achieve everything you want."
"The college have all the necessary infrastructure, facilities and equipment.Each and every branch have well equipped equipment which are necessary for practical that need to be performed while course.The college have smart boards the library are very big and have all the used book.The sports facilities is little weak.Where as the hostel and college leaving space are clean and hygienic. I am a student of btech CSE student and i get to know from my senior about the college.The academic of college is very good in comparison to other college of Dehradun.The curriculum is upto date.Students are made aware of the new opportunities by the faculty.If u give your 100 percent it will make you job ready. The quality of placement is good in computer science .The placement scenario of ece is good but the placement of other branches is very bad.The computer science students almost get all placed try to don't have any back logs till last sem.The average sallary is approx 4 lakh for CSE student but other branches it can be sure. The course cost per year is approx 3 lakh.If you want best academic you can choose this college and placement for CSE is also good.Hence if your motive is to get placement than you must choose CSE and you will get the value of money .I am in CSE and i fill i am getting value for my money. The college campus has very good life.The best is atmosphere and the worst is the college don't have a play ground . Student can engage them in various club.The student,staff as well as faculty are very supportive and helpful. Choose the college fort cse .It is best for cse course other than any branches."
