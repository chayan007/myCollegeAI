They all are having a good knowledge of their respective subjects. Some teach only through the notes.

"DTU has a lush green campus providing the excellent classrooms and lab facilities. The labs are well equipped with the latest technology instruments and provided a room for various research and project opportunities. DTU has a huge sports complex providing opportunity for all kinds of sports and the sports in-charges are open to all kinds of ideas. The gym was recently renovated, and the hostel facilities are good. The medical centre provides the immediate first-aid requirements. The placements are pretty good in DTU. All reputed companies both technical and non-technical, national and multinationals come to the college and offer good placement and internship opportunities to the 3rd and 4th-year students. The package offered highly depends upon the job profile. Non-technical profiles provide the packages as high as 30 lpa whereas, in the mechanical engineering, the packages offered by domestic recruiters are around 8 lpa is the average. Again this depends upon the academic and non-academic skills of the students. The CGPA of 7.5 is considered the safe boundary. DTU has the most educated faculty from all around the country. They are always available to provide all kinds of help a student deserves to get. They are also very much open to the research ideas proposed by the students and also actively take part in being faculty advisors for various tech societies and teams. The course curriculum is at par with both the national as well as international standards for engineering. Based on School / 12th Class Result"

I got into this college just a year back but fells like ages. You will have most fun of your life in this college. Make sure not to miss it. I don't think there is any disadvantage to this college apart from deteriorating quality of professors ( Due to such high student intake). Rest it is an amazing college with most vibrant and fascinating campus life. Being at the national capital it very much have most exposure to industry as it can get. Along with an excellent brand name it never fails to provide opportunities to all. Most of the seniors are placed and have a decent package. Overall the companies that visit campus are very large in number along with all types of offer ranging from core to non-tech to coding profile. My favorite teacher is S.S.P. kumar sir. He was my maths teacher in 1st semester. He was by far the only teacher that really cared about student and was keen on helping each and every student. He would give his full focus to teaching and teaching even hard parts with ease by giving well explained analysis. Though Professors like him are rare in college though there are few more and are only remains of what used to be an amazing faculty back when it was DCE. He has more than 20 years teaching experience in DTU alone. New teachers mostly Phd. Scholars are no match for teaching students and college should refrain from using them. State / National Entrance Exams
DTU is an amazing place with amazing environment. All the seniors are helpful. Most importantly DTU offers a variety of opportunities through which students can enhance their all round development. Many students grab great placements and many secure a good option to go for higher studies. DTU in itself is a brand name. Placements are excellent. More than 250 companies visit every year. Faculty depends from department to department. Mechanical department is strict but considered best across the country. Electrical faculty is not rude. Else teachers of every department are friendly. State / National Entrance Exams

Would recommend this college to the everyone. Just take admission here and get a taste of best college for engineering. Very good placement for the students. The average package is around 6-7LPA.
