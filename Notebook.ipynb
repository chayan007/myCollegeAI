      "This college has good infrastructure and all necessary things. Among other new nits, this nit has a permanent campus and developing at a very faster rate. But one disadvantage is there is no single tree in whole campus. Teachers here are very kind and always ready to help. But There are few faculty who know the topic but aren't able to convey it to the students properly.And Every year there is a tech festival called gyanith in which you can show your talents. The average package of the institution ranges from 4-5 lakhs per annum.Though this is not impressive, around 85% of students gets placed which is good enough. But Do not expect like 24 lpa, they are just an rare case. Obviously if you work hard you may get even more than that.\n",

College is equipped with all day to day facilities and it's quality is very good and they are maintaining all facilities very well so that no one will face any problem. I have studied B. Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering branch and the quality of teaching is very good as compared to other colleges and it is very helpful after the completion of course. No doubt percentage placement at Jaypee college is very much high as compared to other private college in DELHI-NCR. Reason for high placement percentage is college is very supportive to all student and the staff doing very work hard for good placement of all students. For providing the quality education they are charging very nominal fees to all student as compared to other college which aren't providing the quality education.\n",

The professors aren't that great, but the students educate themselves. Very healthy competition exists which pushes you to work harder and harder. The admission process for me was very simple and straightforward as I got in the first online CAP round and froze the seat. I went through a few quora answers to understand VJTI and HSC professors' guidance, and VJTI was definitely my first choice. I'm in my Final Year in CS right now, and I've had the best 4 years of my life in this college. The infrastructure isn't the best but can clearly be overlooked once you have the yummy food in the canteen.\n",

College is equipped with all day to day facilities and it's quality is very good and they are maintaining all facilities very well so that no one will face any problem. I have studied B. Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering branch and the quality of teaching is very good as compared to other colleges and it is very helpful after the completion of course. No doubt percentage placement at Jaypee college is very much high as compared to other private college in DELHI-NCR. Reason for high placement percentage is college is very supportive to all student and the staff doing very work hard for good placement of all students.

      "The infrastructure of our college is amazing. There is cleanliness, and the labs, classrooms and cafes are perfect as per the infrastructure. The ground is good, and in the library, there should be more books of a particular author. Quality of food is very good, and air-conditioners should be working in the corridors also. Wi-Fi facility is good, and I would suggest the whiteboards should be changed with something like educomp system. Teachers are one of the best things about the college. The notes given by them are sufficient, and some subjects are tough, so we need extra classes and care in them. Some teachers should be changed as they aren't able to control the class and teach. The papers are very tough as compared to the classroom studies we have and the level of questions we have solved in the class. Also, there should be more preparatory leaves in between the internals. Placements in our college are good. I am seeing every student getting placed. As our batch is huge than the previous one, we are a bit scared. But we are optimistic that we will get placed. More companies and mass recruiters should come for placements. Students should be taught from the 3rd year what all things are required when someone is sitting for aptitude tests, placements and everything.\n",

      "My college has a very good reputation in all over Gujrat and its infrastructure is also on the top and also my college has very good placements so yeah there are no bad aspects of our college like I couldn't find anything still students say that attendance quota is highest compared to other colleges which I consider as pros of our college so we are prepared for the industry. Admissions were around July of 2018 and we had to first do the verification snd then we  were given admission in the college admission process was quite tedious as students from all Gujrat had come for admission but still we managed to get the admission. I choose this college over others for only one reason and that is highly paid placements which were comparable with the IITs so yeah that is one reason and other I found it's very old and reputed college of Gujrat so as I didn't get in direct my second priority was set to Nirma. Yes, there are blogs on their official site that have formally describe the fea.\n",
      "IIT Tirupati is one of the institutions that I am eligible for my JEE advanced rank. I heard a lot about the progress and improvement of this institute this is one of the main reason I chose this institute and after entering this institute I didn't regret my decision.\n",
      "I applied via the merit management quota and also I went to TN councling. But I didn't get the seat via counciling. After a month I got selected in my college via the merit management category. Since at the time of graduation the high school the cutoff marks got increased I didn't get via counciling and after the counciling some student wrote neat and got selected through that. From those vacant seats I got through the college\n",
      "The placement performance of the college for the mechanical branch is not so praiseworthy. There are only a handful of companies that visit the college for core mechanical jobs. As a result, only a few students get placed in mechanical jobs while the rest either opt for jobs in software companies or prepare for post-graduation. \r\n",
      "However, the placement situation is better for CSE and IT branches with a large number of software companies and startups visiting the campus each year. With the Covid situation in place, the placement scenario looks even bleaker for mechanical, electrical and electronics branches with CSE and IT branches still expected to see good jobs.\r\n",
      "I started preparing for MBA during my final year to have a backup option if I didn't get a place anywhere. However, I was able to ace both the placement and the exam in the end.\n",
      "In 2014 the facility and infrastructure were fine. Wi-Fi and computer labs were excellent. Classrooms were good. Library was also good. I didn't avail hostel facilities as I was a localite. I had friends staying in the hostel. Hostel li...\n",
      "Few people got campus placement. Management was not at all fairer to our batch. We didn't have much campus recruitments in our batch. Numbers of placements were very low. TCS was a mandatory recruiter. Apart from that, we had 3- 4 startups approaching our college.\n",
      "I didn't availed any internships till now but my college do helps in it but I was not interested in doing so.\n",
      "Placements in our college were not good. However, placements are a little bit good for the IT sector. Placements for computer science and IT departments in their core subjects are not up to the standards, and even a single student didn't place from our college. Almost 10-20 students out of 400-500 students were placed in good companies. Our college campus and Gandhi Group campus provides an excellent opportunity for the students of Gandhi group.\n",
      "Top-class infrastructure with all facilities like Labs, library, sports, games, medical facilities. Hostel rooms are spacious, neat, with good quality food. Didn't face any infra related issue during my tenure at th...\n",
      "I took admission in this college in 2019 for B.Tech(CSE) course. Admission is done through JEE and OJEE exams .OJEE is conducted during May -June. I gave OJEE exam because I didn't gave JEE mains. In Orissa one of my relative was studying , he told me about this college and I took admission here . I searched about this college in Google for other information.\n",
      "Honestly, the placements for my batch and our senior batch weren't good and didn't match our knowledge and expectations. Many of my seniors who were best in their academics remained unplaced, and because of that, we had to face a lot of difficulties. We went for some pool campus drives conducted in other colleges, where most of the students got rejected, and even if the students get selected, they never get joining letters. The companies offered technical support and some KPO and BPO roles. Inte...\n",
      "First of all, I am a Pondicherry resident so for Pondicherry people the fees are low through merit and this is also government aided college. So I preferred to study here. Also for campus interviews many MNC's and good IT recruiting companies to come. So I opt here. And the demerits are, to be honest, the teaching staff will not take extra care. It's up to you either you study and succeed or you waste your four years. The admission is through online and we can see the official website (pec.edu) for further updates and information. It is usually done during the month of July and college opens in August. They always give us regular updates and in the process of admission, we can try up to 3rd counselling to get our preferred course. I didn't any website for joining this college but checked for some reviews in collegedunia. I also contacted and discussed my seniors for the admission.\n",
      "I selected NIT-Raipur because, after IITs, NITs are the best institutes in India and being a NITan is a matter of prestige. Due to COVID-19 I didn't apply for many competitive examinations due to the fear of the pandemic and then one day while searching on the internet I saw a notice in which I applied for NIT- Raipur for my masters through UG marks basis during the month of September in the year 2020. So far I am very satisfied with my institute and the way they are managing the online classes.\n",
      "First of all, in 2021 we have gate rank 1 both from mining and metallurgy, also we have plenty of students above 98 percentile in cat, highest being 99.99, now coming to placement, if we consider bio tech and bio med then it is 70 percent otherwise it is 80+, in cse and IT, it is even 100+ yes, highest being 62lpa in 2021 and average is 10.5 LPA.\r\n",
      "So placements are awesome, even those who didn't sit for placement opt for higher studies and do well there bcos of lots of quality coachings at Raipur.\n",
      "My college has a lot of good aspects and bad aspects as well. Now talking about the good aspects, I must say that our department had a studio where practical knowledge was given. We used to make talk shows, edit videos, anchor, and other related works. Also, our faculty were too supportive who were also there to guide us and to make us practically strong along with the conceptual knowledge. Further, the bad aspects were like we had to wait for 5 in the evening from morning 9 am just to attend two or three classes hardly. Multi-cuisine cafeterias were there but the expenses were too high. Other than this, there were library with so many books, journals, magazines, novels, sports complex, and other facilities were also provided to us. Further, to enroll myself to this college, I filled the application form in online mode along with the application fee of rs.1000/- that time. Also, I didn't appear in any entrance test or interview and these are the reasons I chose this college over other\n",
      "Placement facilities are provided by our college. More than 50% of the students have been placed. More than 17 companies hired them based on some basic criteria. But as we are international students, we didn't get opportunities, which is very bad. However, we try to find placements on our own.\n",
      "College infrastructure is good. We have air conditioner, wifi, smartboards in our classroom but the laboratory didn't have the new machines. But since in 2019 it became a university so they are working on it. So the syllabus is that which is given by AICTE to all government colleges and it is a government college. We are learning the old concepts which are in so called syllabus of engineering. We have to study for job The placement record of netaji subhash university of technology is awesome. This is the main reason of many students to join NSUT if we talk about computer and it branch than the have a record of 100% placement. So it cost around 7,81,000 for a four year btech course if you are a hostler than a additional amount of 45000 have to pay per semester as hostel and mess fee. It is totally worth to spend this money beacause atlast placement matters. And this college has a awesome placement record. Colleges campus is full of greenery ( many people say that 80% oxygen of delhi is from NSUT (ps this is a joke) ) . There are many socities for co-curricular activities . Everyone is supportive except admin and they also have their own little hospital. So this is second best college for b tech after IIT D in delhi . Everything is good except admin where the laziest person of this world works. Number of canteen are less . There is no student union in this college so what admin think they do it there is no one to question them\n",

      "Our college is very good in the aspect of infrastructure. Every place is being continuously cleaned from time to time and a large cafeteria. in-spite of being good, the management is still trying hard to develop the place in a better way by constructing new buildings in order to increase count of labs etc. I'm perusing my B tech in the branch of information technology. To be honest, i came here aspiring to choose CSE, but due to some of my academic constraints, i ended up settling in IT. But this didn't ever disappoint me. I have observed the curriculum of both branches. the only difference i could find was regarding the order of subjects being taught and rest is the same. And also all the subjects are eventually taken towards ML and AI, the present boom. So, I feel this is a nice opportunity. Placement quality is good. Honestly, could be better. Because most of the recruiting companies are from the base of Software whereas other students from different branches are sometimes forced to learn programming leaving behind their favorite core subjects just to get placed in software companies. though the Placement cell is trying hard to solve the problem by calling core companies of other branches, it is somehow not happening or might be slowly growing. Our course cost is 1 Lack 80 Thousands per Annam. this money is worth i feel because once when I spoke to one of our closest faculties, he listed the salary packages of them and after knowing them, i thought, this is not unfair. Our campus is placed located in Vadlamudi, Tenali. We have a timetable with 8 periods per day, each of 50 minutes, not at all problematic. then we have library and games periods for 3 days. Additionally, our campus has many student bodies in which a student can be part of. some of the bodies are... Student Activities council for which I'm serving presently as a General Secretary. Then we have National Service Scheme, Entrepreneurship Cell, National Cadet Corps etc which encourage students. Nothing more actually.\n",

      "No there will not be any group discussion and personal interview for admission in our campus.But there will be an Entrance test named VSAT but even if you didn't write the exam you can join in the campus based on your intermediate and EAMCET rank.\n",
      "We have shared part of campus of other institute thus lack of space is a issue. All classrooms and labs are equipped with ACs projectors and high speed wifi. All the campus area is neat and clean and well decorated with nature. Our department have 3 labs thus cannot be equipped for a particular work , also most of the instruments doesn't work effectively. Whose campus and hostel is equipped with wifi. We have 2 hostels for boys and 2 hostels for girls. All the faculties have phd degrees from renowned institute thus many of them have good command over their specializations and thus they help us deeply for their respective fields. Our course curriculum is not updated thus it needs to be updated so that we match current industrial demands. About 90% of students got placed with average package of 4.5 LPA . Maximum package of 39LPA grabed by EEE student from microsoft previous year. We have various recruiters like amazon,oyo,flipkart,dailyhunt,delloite ,L&amp;T ,TATA power etc. College didn't show much interest in increasing average package of the college and always blames students for not having so. I pay around 40k including hostels and 3k per month for mess whose food is of average quality. Paying such a less fee for such experiences with an nit tag makes every penny of money worth for it as any private college cannot offer all this even paying double or triple. Though we have a small campus which always makes problems during sports events and fests but inspite of all these we have 2 fests and various other events in which we enjoy a lot. Seniors and faculties are very helpful and guide us in various issues. Its location is decent as located near market so that we get all desired stuffs. It is also located near one of biggest government hospital thus we didn't have much problems durind health issues or cannot be during emergencies.\n",
      "Small campus thus we do not have well equipped labs and workshops which is must in BTech. The space also creates issues in various sports activities as we do not have sufficient space for football and cricket. But we have space for volleyball, kabbadi etc. All the classrooms are well equipped with ACs &amp; projectors. We have small library thus always have insufficient number of books. All the campus is neat and clean and also well maintained. All the professors are PhD qualified from reputated institutes. They are experts in their subjects and fields thus give us practical insights in them. They also helps us in our project works . Our course curriculum needs to be updated so that we can get insights of new technologies thus meet current industrial demands. For electrical branch few companies visit. We have TATA Power and L&amp;T as our core branch recruiters. Also many EEE students not shortlisted for placement drive of coding related companies inspite of having good skills. But 50-60 % of EEE students got placed with average package of 6LPA . I pay around 40 k per annum for college and hostels fees and mess is charged extra. If placement kept aside , none of the private college can offer such things in such low cost with NIT tag thus every penny of my money worth. Inspite of lack of space we have 2 fests every year along with freshers and fairwell in which all students enjoy a lot. Seniors and faculties are very helpful in academic related issues and also sometimes in day to day conduct. The college is located near Narela market inspite of being far from new Delhi. It also has one govt hospital in nearby so that students didn't have to bother for health related issues.\n",
      "Though campus is small but we'll maintained and very clean . We have share part of campus of some other institute of MHRD . Whole campus is connected with high speed WiFi. Classrooms and labs are equipped with ACs and projector. Labs lacks of certain advance equipment necessary to get depth knowledge. We have a small library thus there is always a race between students to grab books due to less number of books. Small grounds thus cant organise football and cricket but other sports well equipped. I am currently in ECE branch. Our department has lot of well qualified faculties. They all are PhD qualified from reputated institute thus have a good knowledge in their fields and also goes deeper to help the students so that we can understand better. Though course curriculum is not updated as to meet current industrial demands but we work hard on various projects to get practical knowledge and become industrial ready. Quality of placement is average as average package stands around 6 LPA which is less for such reputated institute with central location. We have various recruiters like delloite,L&amp;T, Amazon etc . About 80% of students got placed in different job profile. Previous year one student got 39 LPA package from Microsoft which is maximum for this institute till now. I pay around 40 k per annum including hostel fees due to income certificate criteria. Also I have to pay 3k per month mess fee for average food quality. With such less fees , no institute can offer such facilities especially NIT tag which makes every penny of my money worth. Though we have a shared campus and space is a issue for various academics and extra curriculum activities, we have developed a culture here so that no students think much about it and contribute with full enthusiasm. We have 2-3 fests every year and various other events. Seniors and faculties are very supportive along with non teaching staffs. We have a government hospital nearby it thus students didn't have to bother about health issues. Also there is a market near it to get daily essentials.\n",
      "Infrastructure is not good as due to small in size we cannot have well equipped labs and workshops thus we do to DTU for workshops. Small library thus we have insufficient quantity of books. Playground is good for volleyball kabbadi etc but not for cricket and football as they require big grounds. Whole campus is well maintained as it is very neat and clean. Also the classrooms and labs have ACs WiFi and projectors. We have 2 boys hostel and 1 girl hostel due to less number of girls students. Every faculties of the college is PhD qualified this have depth knowledge in his field. I am currently in electrical department which has good faculties who helps lot in our studies and project works. Our course curriculum is somewhat outdated thus it needs updation to meet current industrial demands so that we can match the industrial norms easily. We have very few companies from core sector. Only L&amp;T and TATA Power comes from the core sector as I know. Even if the students of our branch have good coding skills,they are made ineligible for placements in coding companies due to prioritise to CSE department. But inspite of all these, highest package of college grabbed by student of our department previous year in Microsoft bagging 39 LPA . About 80 % of college students got placed in different profile with average package of 6 LPA. I pay around 1.6 lacs per annum including hostels fee because of income category above 5 LPA . Also I pay around 3 k per month as mess fee whose food quality is average. For such fees , any private college cannot provide such kind of academics and facilities thus every penny of my money worths. Though space bears a dark chapter , we adjust and work in way so that it hinders less. Thus we have one sport fest and one cultural fest name saptrang every year in which we learn leadership and coordinating skills ,also we enjoy a lot in these. Seniors and teachers are very supportive and friendly in nature, especially staffs of the college helps in day to at conduct . It is located near Narela Market we didn't have to bother for daily essentials stuffs. it has a government hospital at 200m.\n",
      "Our college has sports ground for volley ball, badminton, basketball, kabaddi etc but ground for cricket and football becomes short due to small campus space.

We have 2 hostels for boys one is in kundli which is 12 km away from campus and another one is near campus. Also one hostel for girls inside campus.

Placement for our branch is a bit disappointment due to less number of core companies visiting for placement drives. Also students of our department with good coding skills were not made eligible many a times for placement. I pay around 40k per annum including academics and hostels. Also I have to pay 3k per month for mess with average food quality. With such low cost, none of the college can offer such kind of facilities thus every penny of my money worths for this. Inspite of lack of space which always creates issues during fest and workshops. But we work hard so that it's issues reduces to minimum extent.

Though course curriculum needs some updation to meet current industrial demands,we work on various projects to get practical insights and become job ready. Placement is a bit disappointment for our department due to low number of companies from core branch and also students of our department hardly get shortlisted for coding companies inspite of good knowledge. Average salary for our department stands around 5 LPA and for the college it is around 6 LPA. Highest package till now is 39 LPA by student of EEE previous year from Microsoft. College should work hard to get more companies from core sector. My tuition fees is about 40 k per annum due to income criteria, including hostels. I have to pay 3k per month for mess whose food quality is only sometimes good. But inspite of all these, no college can offer such facilities with such low fees. Thus my money getting worth.

With such low fees ,no college can offer such facilities, especially an NIT tag thus every penny of my money worths. Hostel far away from campus during 1st and 2nd year of college and small campus is worst part of campus life. Students here engage in various clubs including cultural technical and sports club. We also have cultural technical and sports fest every year with support of these clubs and cooperation of various students. In these fest every student work hard so to make it success and enjoy in it. It is located in far from New Delhi in Narela near market and big government hospital.\n",
      "We have small campus . New campus is under construction and we get till end of this year hopefully. Small space thus we didn't have well equipped labs and workshop thus we go to DTU for some workshop. Whole campus is clean and maintained with lush green grasses and various kinds of trees. We have arrangments for volleyball basketball badminton Kabaddi but Cricket and football cannot organised due to space constraints. All the classes and labs have projectors AC and WiFi. All the faculties are PhD qualified thai have good expertise in their domain . But inadequate infrastructure entertain small labs which sometimes decrease moral .

Lowest package this year stands around 4.8 LPA of CTC. My tuition fees is 80 k per annum due to income criteria. It includes hostel fee as well . I pay 3k per month as mess fees. With such less fees no college can offer such kind of facilities and especially this is an NIT which cannot compared with many of private College and other NITs. Thus my money worths. Space is worst feature of campus life as it forced for hostels far away from college and inadequate labs &amp; workshop which are disappointment issues. But inspite of all these we have a culture here of coordination which could be seen during cultural sports and technical fest every year. In these all students and teachers coordinate to make it huge success. It's location is very good as it is located near market and a government hospital thus students didn't have to bother much.\n",
      "We have shared part of campus of other institute thus lack of space is a issue. All classrooms and labs are equipped with ACs projectors and high speed wifi. All the campus area is neat and clean and well decorated with nature. Our department have 3 labs thus cannot be equipped for a particular work , also most of the instruments doesn't work effectively. Whose campus and hostel is equipped with wifi. We have 2 hostels for boys and 2 hostels for girls. All the faculties have phd degrees from renowned institute thus many of them have good command over their specializations and thus they help us deeply for their respective fields. Our course curriculum is not updated thus it needs to be updated so that we match current industrial demands. About 90% of students got placed with average package of 4.5 LPA . Maximum package of 39LPA grabed by EEE student from microsoft previous year. We have various recruiters like amazon,oyo,flipkart,dailyhunt,delloite ,L&amp;T ,TATA power etc. College didn't show much interest in increasing average package of the college and always blames students for not having so. I pay around 40k including hostels and 3k per month for mess whose food is of average quality. Paying such a less fee for such experiences with an nit tag makes every penny of money worth for it as any private college cannot offer all this even paying double or triple. Though we have a small campus which always makes problems during sports events and fests but inspite of all these we have 2 fests and various other events in which we enjoy a lot. Seniors and faculties are very helpful and guide us in various issues. Its location is decent as located near market so that we get all desired stuffs. It is also located near one of biggest government hospital thus we didn't have much problems durind health issues or cannot be during emergencies.\n",
      "Small campus thus we do not have well equipped labs and workshops which is must in BTech.

But we have space for volleyball, kabbadi etc. All the classrooms are well equipped with ACs &amp; projectors. We have small library thus always have insufficient number of books. All the campus is neat and clean and also well maintained. All the professors are PhD qualified from reputated institutes. They are experts in their subjects and fields thus give us practical insights in them. They also helps us in our project works . Our course curriculum needs to be updated so that we can get insights of new technologies thus meet current industrial demands. For electrical branch few companies visit. We have TATA Power and L&amp;T as our core branch recruiters. Also many EEE students not shortlisted for placement drive of coding related companies inspite of having good skills. But 50-60 % of EEE students got placed with average package of 6LPA . I pay around 40 k per annum for college and hostels fees and mess is charged extra. If placement kept aside , none of the private college can offer such things in such low cost with NIT tag thus every penny of my money worth. Inspite of lack of space we have 2 fests every year along with freshers and fairwell in which all students enjoy a lot.

Classrooms and labs are equipped with ACs and projector. Labs lacks of certain advance equipment necessary to get depth knowledge. We have a small library thus there is always a race between students to grab books due to less number of books. Small grounds thus cant organise football and cricket but other sports well equipped. I am currently in ECE branch. Our department has lot of well qualified faculties. They all are PhD qualified from reputated institute thus have a good knowledge in their fields and also goes deeper to help the students so that we can understand better.

The highest salary offered was in between Rs. 16,000 per month to Rs. 18,000 per month. Many big and small companies visited our college to hire students.

      "Placements at IITM are okay, but not good as even in the previous year many students didn't get placed from college. Although the college claim for 100% placements, and it is not true. Students are offered mostly with the profile of backend support and not a software developer or web designing. Major recruiters in the previous year are TCS, Wipro, etc. The average salary offered will be around Rs. 20,000 to 30,000 per month.\n",
      "Infrastructure is good. Library has enough books for reference. I didn't stay in hostel so I won't be able to say anything about hostel facilities. Canteen's food is nice. Other than studies college focuses on sports also. There are ...\n",
      "I preferred this university as it is a government university and the tuition fees is also very less approx. 32,000 for the whole program which is very less as compared to the private universities which charges around Rs. 1,50,000 for the whole program. At Panjab University, the admission process was also simple. After the cut-off list was uploaded, the candidates were called for the admission process at the department itself and the list of the required documents was also provided beforehand, in order to prevent any rush at the last moment. After the verification of all the documents and the interview (happened for some students only), the final list was prepared and students were admitted to the program. The good thing about this university is that the academics is really very good, the teachers are very informative and helpful. Also, the ambience is amazing with lush green trees and gardens everywhere providing a good and relaxed environment to study and nurture ourselves. Each year book fair is also held in the university to explore the reading world. But, there are also some negative points like the university still relies on the paper work in this digital era. Most of the things are done on paper so it takes a lot of time to process the information which is very tiring. Recently only, they have started going digital in some areas and the digital transformation is very slow. The flow of information is very slow, like I said-paper work exists. Also, the events held in the university are not able to reach everyone on time due to this factor.I didn't used any website or blogs while selecting this college as it is a reputed university, so I knew already about this university. I just went through this university's website. So, that's how I landed here.\n",
      "All the students are not placed, and it is because placement opportunities are less despite being good. Many students do not opt for placements and generally prefer to pursue a master's degree for better opportunities. Due to these reasons, only 10-15% of the students from the batch got placed. DE Shaw and L&T are among the top companies which come for placements. The average salary package offered is 2 LPA. In our batch, we didn't get any internship opportunities, and it was all about books and ...\n",
      "The infrastructure of our college isn't good, and it didn't meet our expectations. The labs, halls and classrooms are not as good as we thought. The classrooms, labs, halls and workshops are not good.\n",
      "A maximum number of students got internships through their references in core companies. Our college didn't provide many internship opportunities for students in their respective courses. I am in the data science field, but we are also provided with a full-stack web developer role. So, I had to find internships on my own.\n"

      "The college has overall great views at all around because it is located in foothills of Mussorie. So, whenever there is a cloudy day you can't stop yourself to capture the landscape. Now talking about the academics as the labs are well equipped but there is lack of proper academic calender and also there is lack faculty in the department for the different subjects. Also all the academic buildings are equipped with good wifi network. All the campus building are clean surroundings. I am pursuing my BTECH in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Automobile Engineering is good but here the faculty&amp;labs not available for various optional subjects which we wanted to learn in the last semesters. The quality of placement for mechanical branch is almost zero percent. Out of 100students 1 or 3 gets placed.The ratio of placement for mechanical branch is very less.All you need to do is to improve your academic and look for out campus. The course cost approx 2.5 lakh per year.If you look at academic It's totally value for money but if your need is placement than you will not get the worth of your money.Very few companies visit for hiring Mechanical and Automobile Engineering students. Yeah the money which I spent is worth for doing this course. The overall campus life is good. As, here we celebrate different festivals with great enthusiasm under college faculty guidelines. Different events also organised by students such as Youthopia which is annual cultural and technical fest and lots of small events which are organised by students of different courses. The overall experience at this college was good for me till now. Initially when I came to this college at that time the management was good but now I'm in 3 year and at this time management was not so good. Hope they will recover there system back .\n",
      "The college has overall great views at all around because it is located in foothills of Mussorie. So, whenever there is a cloudy day you can't stop yourself to capture the landscape. Now talking about the academics as the labs are well equipped but there is lack of proper academic calender and also there is lack faculty in the department for the different subjects. Also all the academic buildings are equipped with good wifi network. All the campus building are clean surroundings. I am pursuing my BTECH in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Automobile Engineering is good but here the faculty&amp;labs not available for various optional subjects which we wanted to learn in the last semesters. The quality of placement for mechanical branch is almost zero percent. Out of 100students 1 or 3 gets placed.The ratio of placement for mechanical branch is very less.All you need to do is to improve your academic and look for out campus. The course cost approx 2.5 lakh per year.If you look at academic It's totally value for money but if your need is placement than you will not get the worth of your money.Very few companies visit for hiring Mechanical and Automobile Engineering students. Yeah the money which I spent is worth for doing this course. The overall campus life is good. As, here we celebrate different festivals with great enthusiasm under college faculty guidelines.

      "Hostels are well maintained. We can't say that food in mess is excellent but far better than what other college is prov...\n",
      "Actually I like the environment and the infrastructure very much. It's a very neat and clean classroom and hostel . Food is very good. Teaching staff also very friendly. But having high restrictions. Good quality teaching. It's good to go there but you do not have extra curriculum activities. Very rare functions and all. Management is rude. If you can't fill the fee by their deadline you won't able to sit in the semister exam . So think twice before joining.\n",
      "Collaege infrastructure is good and well maintained and facilities given for us in our collage is good and well maintained and equipments that are in the lab are with high internet speed but I belongs to electrical grp. Academics is very good and quality of teaching and education is also good based on the students interest they will teach the consider concept and make us to understand them in easy and simple way and in simple manner. Placements are very high beacuse of due to demand in quality of eduaction.the collage management will will send people to the placement through percentage and they will check our performance and they will offer high salary package. Our collage giving value for the money but the collage management has incraese the course fee for every year it is mainly effected for the parents who are living in low calss or middle calss will suffer alot. Collage campus iwill give so many wrost and good if we take anything in positive way then there will be only good memories but if we think in negative way then it iwill be in the wrong way so taht we can't enjoy our campus life . During collage days students have to take more interest on enjoyment like class bunk and going to movies without having any proper occasion so please make the eduaction and enjoyment in equal way so that it will be in good and simple life\n",

      "10% placement. We're getting the placement at very low packages. We can't assume higher packages than 2-3 lakhs per annum. Only a few students are placed in our batch and our senior batch. No internship is provided by the college.\n",
      "The Wi-Fi facility is available on the campus, but all the students can't access it. Labs have a wide range of equipment. The library has a vast collection of books, but you are allowed to take only 2 books at a time. The college doesn't provide any medical facilities. There is no playground for sports. Classrooms and labs are pretty good and are equipped with all the required facilities. The only good part about CIPET is it has good labs with good equipment. The quality of the food served is go...\n",
      "It has bad rules uh will not be allowed to go out of CLG when uh need if the classes are locked uh will just have to run here and there uh will not get place to sit because where ever uh sit some one will get angry on uh its just hell for me but its also heaven for some who can't do anything in there life and are just a guys like do not even know how to speak English write English and do not have normal general knwldge and do not know the table of 12 its heaven for them it will make uh engineer\n",
      "As Covid-19 hit us during the placements season, only a few recruiting companies came to the college. As it was the first batch passing out of the college, we can't compare it to the previous years. The students were placed mostly off-campus, and some students went for higher studies.\n",
      "Good Aspects -  The campus is good and provides us with all facilities, Labs are Well Developed and contains all the modern equipment.\r\n",
      "The Infrastructure is nicely built and even if the campus is small it still has all the facilities required. The coding culture of the college is also good as this is an IT college all the IT-based companies come and the Campus Placement Of CS/IT branch is good respectively.\r\n",
      "Bad Aspects - The Mess food is not really good and is really bland. The worst part is the Exams system is not really good and you can't Score a high GPA like other colleges. The ECE Branch campus placement is bad because only a few Core companies come in our college \r\n",
      "Admission Process - There is a merit-based counseling system based on your JEE mains Rank. You have to go to college and Lock your preference based on your rank.\r\n",
      "Reasons Preferring this college -  The campus placement is comparatively better.\r\n",
      "Searched Quora, Collegedunia, and Other Websites.\n",
      "From 1st year onwards, you will be having 13-14 subjects, including practicals. Labs for practicals are good enough for students to do experiments as groups. For B. Tech students, the library has a huge range of books respective of their subjects. However, I suggest you to borrow books 2 weeks prior to any exams. Various novels and fictions are also accessible, but you can't borrow them. Rooms have centralised air-conditioners, and I hope they're working now. In terms of infrastructure and facil...\n",
      "Facilities are quite good. We can't expect more from a state government college but still there are 5 huge hostels each for boys and girls. Central Wi-Fi system ...\n",
      "My college is good in placements and also have a strict environment for studies so that all students should focus on their studies and exploring new things, But it is too strict that a normal student can't explore much, It takes student by their JEE mains percentile through JAC counseling, as on the normal conditions that are before covid JAC counseling starts in June and it has 6 normal rounds and 3 spots round and 1 special spot around, it takes about 1.5 - 2  months.\n",
      "Average - college is good because there are perks of being NITian and bad in the way that we do not have our own campus so we can't avail much facilities.\n",
      "One of my friends refer me and she told me this is the best college for your course. And yes she is right. I got the best faculty here. The environment is too good. Teachers are always there for helping you. The bad thing is that the canteen is small so you can't enjoy that much but the food quality is good. Washrooms are clean. Talking about friends I make many friends or lost too. Its a part of your life. You meet many people or lost them too. College is strict for their rules and regulations. \r\n",
      "The fee structure is 2.70 lakhs for 3 years. If you wanna know more you can check the reviews on google or directly call them for more info.\n",
      "7th semester onwards you are eligible for placement. Companies visiting the campus for core job is less but you will get many mass recruiting companies which shift the overall placement to above 80% but you can't get enough CTC in those. Planning to write gate to get a good college in masters.\n",
      "If you are fine with the fee, then I can assure you that you can't get any better facilities for your money's worth. Because of the lo...\n"

Since Jadavpur University is a Tier 1 college, the placements are top-notch. 85 to 90 percentage of the students are placed here in different sectors like IT & software, consulting, finance, core, R&D, the highest package being 65 LPA. Many students get internship offers and PPOs. Infrastructure is decent considering such low fees (Rs 12000 total for 4 years). Hostel and mess facilities are good too (charges are Rs 300/month approx). There is a huge Central Library, Blue Earth Workshop, OAT, free high-speed WiFi, good classroom halls and labs. Sports facilities are fascinating for every sports lover. The extremely qualified faculties are quite helpful. The campuses are beautiful, green and very well connected. Many clubs are there attracting interested students. Research culture and alumni network are great. Various scholarships are given. I preferred it for its low fees and high national and international ranking.>, <Review: One of the reputed colleges in Maharashtra. It offers 9 UG courses/degrees. If you are going for computer science go and take it. Placement is really good when compared to other colleges. The admission process is based on the MH-CET merit basis. For higher branches like computer science, entc, mechanical your rank should be in <1000. Admissions start in the month of June. The reason for referring to this college is it gives a really good atmosphere, it has hundreds of clubs to join, four-five big events, regatta, DJ nights and all.>]>"
