0,"There are many clubs ranging from music to robotics, etc. However, only the tech clubs enjoy success. There are multiple tech clubs like BYLD(the most famous one), Foobar, etc which usually deal with programming, web development, networking, etc. There are clubs related to music, dance, arts, photography, dramatics, etc but they are not very popular. The college has two major fests- Esya(tech fest) and Odyssey(Cultural fest). As the college is kind of recent, it has excellent infrastructure. the buildings are built in the modern architecture, the labs are well equipped and the classrooms are spacious. The hostels are in a good condition.I won't call it excellent but compared to other colleges they'd seem like a five star. The rooms are equipped with AC. The internet speed is amazing.Most of the rooms are on a double or triple sharing basis.The rooms and bathrooms are cleaned regularly so you will have no complaint about that aspect. however, the bathrooms are a little cramped. There are no attached washrooms to the rooms. The mess food is atrocious. I have heard complaints of worms being found in the food.The entire campus has good wi-fi speed. The library is ideal. There are rooms for mass meetings, etc. There is a reading lobby which is usually the hub of students and in general, a very cheerful place.This is probably one of the very few colleges in India in which all academic staff has a doctoral degree. The teachers are excellent. You have to give quizzes, assignments, projects, etc within the deadline. Most of the time you'll be buried in coursework. In the end, it seems worth it for you learn twice as much as a student from any other college. What I love is the framework of the course. it is a credit based system, kind of like in the US universities. You get to tailor the courses to a certain extent and can choose your own electives ranging from theatre appreciation to philosophy. So if I want to, I can study both History and Programming at the same time.The fee structure of IIIT, New Delhi for B.Tech program is INR 2,50,000 per annum.The placements rates for a college that has not been established for even ten years are outstanding. Almost all the students get placed. We have a strong alumni network and they are touch in with the current students of the college as well, guiding them.The admissions to the college on the basis of JEE MAIN rank. Further, the students who have excellent achievements in extracurricular (sports, dramatics, art, etc) get bonus marks. Also, the college lays emphasis on the all-round development of a student."
